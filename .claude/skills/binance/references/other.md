**Contents:**
- Binance Login (OAuth2)

The Binance OAuth (2.0) allows users to share specific data with an 3rd application while keeping their accountsâ€™ API keys or login credentials, and other information private.

The Binance API allows developers to use the OAuth2 protocol to allow a Binance user to grant a 3rd party application full or partial access to his/her account.

For example, an application can use OAuth 2.0 to obtain users' Binance wallet addresses. Binance Login supports web/app applications for now.

Binance Login(Oauth2.0), is only provided to close ecosystem partners now. Please reach to our business team for more details.
