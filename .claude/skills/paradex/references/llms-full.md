# Starknet First Appchain

> Starknet is a zero-knowledge proof roll-up chain that posts proofs of state changes in L2 that an L1 contract verifies is indeed a valid state change as per the business logic in L2.

Starkware, the team behind StarkEx, are close strategic and technology partners of the project. You can learn more about the following topics:

# Chain Information

> How to find out information on the Paradex Chain

Paradex shows up-to-date chain information at [https://app.paradex.trade/status](https://app.paradex.trade/status) like the following:

<Frame caption="*Note that this may not be the current information! Please go to the status linked above to see current information">
  <img src="file:e86e1d29-55a3-4533-89d6-22473bcfa640" alt="" />
</Frame>

You can also check out sites like [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/paradex) to see more information on our chain, smart contracts, locked volume, etc.

## Chain Decimals

1. **Decimal Precision**: In Starknet's Cairo language, we can't use decimal numbers directly. Instead, we use a fixed precision of 8 decimal places. This means we multiply all numbers by (`10^8`) to turn them into whole numbers.
2. **Example**: Say the price of something, like `ETH-USD-PERP`, is `$3,309.33`. To put this on the blockchain, we multiply it by (`10^8`) to get (`330,933,000,000`). This way, we can work with whole numbers instead of decimals.
3. **Order Signature Generation**: When we create signatures for orders, we use these converted whole numbers. It ensures that all calculations on the blockchain are accurate and consistent.
4. **User Interface and Libraries**: Most of the time, our code takes care of these conversions for you. But if you're writing code, you need to remember to convert your numbers to the right precision for generating correct order signatures. This does **not** apply to any API values.

This approach helps keep things simple and consistent across different parts of the blockchain system, making sure everyone's on the same page when it comes to handling fractional values.


# Server Location

### API Server Location <a href="#api-server-location" id="api-server-location" />

Our API server is located in the AWS AP-NORTHEAST-1 region (Tokyo).

There should be no reason to favor using a single Availability Zone (AZ) in your implementation since any AZ in ap-northeast-1 should be able to connect to Paradex.  Should you need to specify a single AZ, you can safely use apne1-az1 as it has been declared Paradex's primary AZ.

#### Clock Synchronization

The best way to synchronize your clock with our servers is via the Amazon time service.


# Global IP Addresses

Paradex API leverages AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic to our infrastructure in Tokyo. It provides us with static IP addresses that are geographically distributed across the AWS global network.

These IP addresses may appear to be located in the US by some DNS lookup tools due to AWS being a US-based company. However, the actual path your traffic takes prioritizes the closest AWS edge location, ensuring efficient routing to our Tokyo infrastructure. This minimizes latency and delivers a smooth user experience regardless of your geographical location.

For a more in-depth explanation, check out the [AWS Global Accelerator docs](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/features/).

## Deposit Max USDC

![Screenshot](file:b678defa-4c72-4372-b304-59647973d479)

Click "Max" to auto-fill your entire USDC balance instead of typing amounts, reducing the time it takes to get back to trading.
USDC balances for accounts on all chains are now visible in the deposit modal. This was previously limited to the Ethereum network.

Thanks to [@manifestryker](https://discord.com/channels/1107916848193863740/1263859118318420031/1395711695925805077) for suggesting this improvement.

## Bug fixes & improvements

* Searchable market alias (Gold for PAXG Options)
* Fixed order size slider calculations
* RPI savings calculation now adjusts for aggregated RPI pricees


# July 25, 2025

## Portfolio Margin (Invite Only Beta)

![Screenshot](file:7f6c3b9b-6ef3-44c4-86ce-e09bdc009fd8)

We've launched Portfolio Margin in invite-only beta, a sophisticated risk management system that evaluates your entire portfolio holistically rather than each position independently.
By recognizing correlations and hedged positions, it typically reduces margin requirements while providing a more accurate reflection of your portfolio's true risk profile.
This feature is ideal for active traders, options strategists, and sophisticated users seeking improved capital efficiency.

## PAXG Perp Options

![Screenshot](file:b81d5d12-a4a1-4473-97a7-dc798290cdf7)

We've added PAXG (Pax Gold) perpetual options to our platform, expanding beyond our existing BTC, ETH, SOL, and HYPE markets.
As our first lower volatility perpetual options market, PAXG opens up new strategic opportunities for traders looking to explore options
strategies in a more stable underlying asset tied to gold prices. This addition provides diversification for options traders seeking exposure beyond high-volatility crypto assets.

## RPI Savings on Orderbook

![Screenshot](file:ab004a73-64b4-4428-b5b2-3a8ca98443b9)

We've added a Retail Price Improvement (RPI) savings popup to the orderbook that displays estimated slippage and RPI savings when you hover over orders,
allowing you to quantify the price improvement you receive when trading on Paradex.

## Bug fixes & improvements

* Mobile Markets Menu now includes sortable Open Interest, 24h Volume, and Funding Rate data for easier market assessment
* TWAP orders now have access to RPI liquidity ([@stochasticfranklin](https://discord.com/channels/1107916848193863740/1263859118318420031/1395621485217054760))
* Fixed bug where TPSL market order fails when set too close to liquidation price


# July 18, 2025

## Interchain Deposits powered by Hyperlane (Beta)

![Screenshot](file:90fa72a2-2cb1-4534-9eda-7b07289eac5d)

USDC deposits are now supported from Solana, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Starknet through Hyperlane's permissionless interoperability protocol.
This initial release focuses on deposits with a \$250,000 liquidity cap during the testing phase.
Withdrawal support and additional networks will be added following successful testing,
with Paradex Vault tokens also being upgraded for full multi-chain compatibility in the coming weeks.

## Bridge using Orbiter Finance

![Screenshot](file:a2bcd676-b9a3-4078-bab9-dcbcba5569d2)

Added Orbiter Bridge support for deposits and withdrawals across 17 blockchain networks.
This provides an additional bridging option alongside existing methods (Paradex Bridge, Layerswap, RhinoFi, and Hyperlane)
for transferring funds to and from the platform.

## Estimated P\&L in TP/SL order builder

![Screenshot](file:63c2fa8b-1e1e-4726-a493-c41b1ce1f74a)

Estimated profit/loss amounts in dollars now display directly within the Take Profit/Stop Loss section of the order builder's basic view.
This information was previously available elsewhere but is now shown inline to reduce navigation and provide immediate P\&L visibility
when setting TP/SL levels.

Thanks to [@c45p4r](https://discord.com/channels/1107916848193863740/1263859118318420031/1391806445602865343) for suggesting this improvement.

## Bug fixes & improvements

* View positions from Trade Summary page without navigating to separate screen (mobile)
* Apply default max slippage per market when user hasn't configured custom slippage settings


# July 11, 2025

## Calculate Size in TPSL

![Screenshot](file:da4726cc-09ff-4ec6-b34f-5c731fbe7fb4)

You can now specify your desired risk amount in dollars when setting TPSL orders,
and the system will automatically calculate the appropriate position size.
This eliminates the need to manually calculate position sizing or use external tools to determine how much you'll risk on each trade.

Thanks to [@warren\_muppets](https://x.com/warren_muppets/status/1937533397418803578) for suggesting this improvement.

## Display usernames in Switch Account modal

![Screenshot](file:a5d23d46-eb01-4c11-93f3-8a11ee5593d0)

Account usernames now display in the Switch Account modal (alongside wallet addresses) and main account menu (top-right corner).
This makes it easier to identify and switch between different accounts and sub-accounts without relying solely on wallet addresses for identification.

Thanks to [@therealzerve](https://discord.com/channels/1107916848193863740/1263859118318420031/1391128789202763828) for suggesting this improvement.

## Portfolio and Account Summary now show Total UP\&L

![Screenshot](file:55ee3a10-7855-4d29-a63c-20900a72b2ac)

Portfolio and Account Summary previously displayed only account balance and unrealized trading P\&L,
excluding unrealized funding which is critical for portfolio assessment and order planning.
These sections now show Total Unrealized P\&L, combining both unrealized trading P\&L and unrealized funding for complete portfolio visibility.

Thanks to [@addr1kajjuw8l6p3ndl](https://discord.com/channels/1107916848193863740/1263859118318420031/1391656078940573716) for suggesting this improvement.

## Withdraw vault tokens in USDC terms

![Screenshot](file:b52be145-8838-4d8d-a836-1ba6c48c6929)

Vault withdrawals now allow you to specify the target amount in USDC rather than vault tokens (vTokens).
This eliminates the need to manually calculate vToken amounts and makes withdrawals more intuitive,
though the final USDC amount may vary slightly due to slippage.

Thanks to [@vukt97](https://discord.com/channels/1107916848193863740/1263859118318420031/1391057755581841558) for suggesting this improvement.

Track your trades more easily with our new fill aggregation feature.
When a single order results in multiple partial fills, you can now view them as one consolidated entry instead of cluttered individual fills.

Toggle between detailed and consolidated views using the "Aggregate" option in your Trade History tab and TradingView chart.

Thanks to [@vladkens](https://discord.com/channels/1107916848193863740/1263859118318420031/1387885711482425586) for suggesting this improvement.

## Resizable charts on trade page

# Paradex XP - 4,000,000 XP Per Week

**Season 2 is LIVE!** Earn your share of 4,000,000 XP distributed weekly every Friday.

Experience Points (XP) are Paradex's universal reward system. Every contribution to the platform earns XP, from trading to providing liquidity to community engagement.

## How to Earn XP

Meaningful user interaction with Paradex earns you XP:

* Trade and maintain open positions
* Provide tight two sided liquidy (see [Quote Quality](./quote-quality))
* Provide collateral to Paradex Vaults (protocol, vtf, community)
* Stay active through trading, referrals, research, and community engagement on X and Discord

<sub>
  \* Linking your social media accounts (e.g., X and Discord) helps us better distinguish legitimate users from Sybils. 
</sub>

## Season 2 Details

* **Duration:** January 3, 2025 - TBD
* **Weekly XP Pool:** 4,000,000 XP
* **Distribution:** Every Friday
* **Extension:** Up to 6 months to optimize conditions for \$DIME token listing

<sub>
  \* Affiliate bonus XP is incremental to the base weekly XP distributed to Paradex users. See the 

  [Referrals page](./referral-program)

   for additional details 
</sub>

<sub>
  \* Quote Quality XP is a component of the base 4M weekly XP. See the 

  [Quote Quality page](./quote-quality)

   page for additional details 
</sub>

### Season 2 Extension

At the end of July 2025, the Paradex Foundation decided to extend Season 2 by up to six (6) months to ensure optimal conditions for the \$DIME token listing.  The Foundation views the 6 month timeline as deliberately conservative and will accelerate listing earlier if growth and traction accelerate sooner. This extension enables the launch of spot trading, dated options, pre-markets, yield bearing synthetic dollars (XUSD).

## Previous Seasons

Pre Season (Beta) and Season 1 ran from February 1, 2024 to January 2, 2025. \~100M XP was distributed in Pres Season and Season 1. See the Paradex Foundation Blog ["(Introducing DIME: the Native Token of the Paradex Network")](https://www.paradex.foundation/blog/introducing-dime-the-native-token-of-the-paradex-network) for additional details.


# Quote Quality Score

> Quote Quality measures how valuable a liquidity provider's (LP) orders are to the market. It rewards LPs who place orders close to the current market price and provide liquidity on both bid and ask sides.

## XP Distribution (225,000 / week)

For the purposes of weekly XP distribution, we sum quote quality by user by market over the week and divide by total number of samples (\~ every 1 minute). This gives us a single average quote quality metric we use for determining a users share of total exchange quote quality.

*Note: Quote Quality XP is as subset of the base 4,000,000 weekly XP distribution.*

### XP Distribution

* **75,000 (33%) - Tier 1 Perps**
* **150,000 (67%) - Tier 2 Perps**

<Tip>
  Distribution subject to change and will be announced weekly along with XP
</Tip>

### The Process

1. **Sample Collection:** Quote Quality samples collected throughout the week
2. **Weekly Average:** Sum all samples ÷ number of samples = your average Quote Quality
3. **Market Share:** Your average ÷ total of all users' averages = your share %
4. **XP Distribution:** Your share % × weekly XP pool = your XP earned

### Key Points

* **Consistency matters**: Need to provide liquidity throughout the week, not just peak times
* **Quality beats quantity**: Tight spreads earn more than large but wide orders
* **Tier separation**: Each instrument tier has its own XP pool
* **Relative competition**: Your rewards depend on your performance vs. other LPs

<Tip>
  Bottom line: Weekly XP = Your sustained liquidity quality as a % of total market quality.
</Tip>

| Order Depth          | How far an order's price is from the reference price (max(TOB, mid) for bids, min(TOB, mid) for asks), measured in basis points (bps).        |
| Scaling factor       | A penalty system that reduces the value of orders placed farther from the reference price                                                     |

## Quote Quality Calculation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Measure Order Distance from Market">
    For each order, we calculate how far its price is from the current reference price:

    $$
    \text{Bid Order Depth}=\frac{(\max(\text{TOB}, \text{mid}) - \text{Bid Order Price})}{\max(\text{TOB}, \text{mid})}*10,000
    $$

    $$
    \text{Ask Order Depth}=\frac{(\text{Ask Order Price} - \min(\text{TOB}, \text{mid}))}{\min(\text{TOB}, \text{mid})}*10,000
    $$

    Where:

    * **TOB** = Top-of-book price (best bid for bids, best ask for asks)
    * **mid** = Mid-market price (average of best bid and best ask)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Distance Penalty">
    Orders farther from the reference price receive exponentially less weight. Each order's adjusted value is calculated as:

    $$
    \text{Adjusted Order Size}=\text{Order Size}~*~\exp\big(-\text{Scaling Factor}~*~\text{Order Depth}\big)
    $$

    The scaling factors are instrument-specific and designed so orders at maximum spread receive only 1% weight. Orders beyond the Max Spread are completely excluded from calculations.

    | **Term**                                   | **Tier 1 Perps**    | **Tier 2 Perps** | **Perp Options** |
    | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    | Instruments                                | BTC, ETH, SOL Perps | All other Perps  | All Perp Options |
    | Max Spread <br />(Distance from Reference) | 5 bps               | 15 bps           | 15 bps           |
    | Weight at Max Spread                       | 1.00%               | 1.00%            | 1.00%            |
    | Scaling Factor                             | \~0.92              | \~0.31           | \~0.31           |

    <Frame caption="Quote scaling functions are set by instrument and tier = Tier 1 Perps, Tier 2 Perps, Perp Options.">
      <img src="file:081ddd2d-7b8e-42e3-827a-40689e5c0641" alt="Quote scaling functions are set by instrument and tier = Tier 1 Perps, Tier 2 Perps, Perp Options." />
    </Frame>

    $$
    \text{Scaling Factor} = -\frac{\ln(\text{Weight at Max Spread})}{\text{Max Spread}}
    $$
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sum Adjusted Orders by Side">
    We then sum all adjusted orders by side:

    $$
    \begin{cases}
    \text{Sample Bid Quality} = \sum_{\text{Buy orders } b_i} \text{Adj. Bid Order Size}(b_i) \\
    \text{Sample Ask Quality} = \sum_{\text{Sell orders } s_i} \text{Adj. Ask Order Size}(s_i)
    \end{cases}
    $$
  </Step>

  <Step title="Calculate Sample Quote Quality">
    The system heavily rewards two-sided market making by putting a 70% weight on the minimum of bid and ask sample quality:

    $$
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
    \text{Sample Quote Quality} = \\
    70\% \times \min(\text{Sample Bid Quality}, \text{Sample Ask Quality})  +  \\
    30\% \times \max(\text{Sample Bid Quality}, \text{Sample Ask Quality})
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    $$

    **Why 70% weight on minimum?** <br />
    This incentivizes providing liquidity on both sides rather than just one side of the market.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Calculate Moving Average">
    The final Quote Quality smooths out short-term fluctuations using a 20% weight on new measurements:

    $\text{Quote Quality}(t_{i+1})=20\%*\text{Sample Quote Quality}(t_{i+1})+80\%*\text{Quote Quality}(t_{i})$
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Retail Price Improvement

> Better pricing for retail traders with selective order visibility

## Overview

Retail Price Improvement (RPI) is a specialized order type that provides better pricing and execution opportunities for retail traders while protecting market makers from toxic flow. It achieves this through selective order visibility - orders are visible in the UI but hidden from API access.

### How RPI Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Visible on UI" icon="eye">
    Enabling retail users to access improved pricing and better execution opportunities
  </Card>

  <Card title="Hidden from API" icon="eye-slash">
    Protecting market makers from potentially harmful trading patterns
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Trader Profiles

Paradex offers two trading profiles to cater to different user needs: Standard and Retail.
Activating the Retail profile is opt-in and eligibility is determined through authentication and activity checks.

### Retail Profile (Opt-in) - Default for UI Traders

Suitable for retail traders seeking price improvement.

<Card title="Faster Fills for Retail Traders">
  To improve trade execution speed for retail users, API traders now receive a **75% fee discount** when they match with passive orders from a Retail Profile. This incentive is designed to get your passive orders filled faster. No action is required on your part.
</Card>

* **Order Submission Speed Bump:** `500ms`
* **Order Cancel Speed Bump:** `300ms`
* **Activity Thresholds**: If exceeded, orders will lose access to RPI liquidity.
  * `5` orders / second
  * `10` orders / minute
  * `60` orders / hour
  * `750` orders / 24 hours

To obtain retail token pass `?token_usage=interactive` to `/v1/auth` endpoint.

### Standard Profile - Default for API Traders

All orders submitted without retail JWT token are classed as Standard Profile.

<Note>
  Both Retail and Standard profile order management are subject to [Global Account Rate Limits](/api/general-information/rate-limits/api)
</Note>

## Matching Rules

RPI orders follow specific matching rules to ensure fair and efficient trading:

1. **Retail-Only Matching**: RPI orders will only match with orders placed by non-algorithmic users and do not execute against orders submitted via API.

2. **Post-Only Requirement**: All RPI orders must be [Post-Only](/trading/placing-orders/order-instructions#post-only), meaning they will only provide liquidity and never take liquidity.

3. **Execution Priority**: RPI orders have the lowest execution priority, regardless of when they're placed. They will only be filled after all non-RPI orders at the same price level have been executed.

## Order Behavior and Visibility

1. **Order Persistence**: Accepted and resting RPI orders remain active until cancelled by the user, even if they are no longer at the best bid or offer (BBO).

2. **Cross Book Behavior**: The orderbook visible in the UI may appear crossed due to RPI orders that are not matching with API orders. The crossed section of the book is visible and highlighted in the UI. However, the API orderbook remains uncrossed as it does not contain any RPI orders.

## Limitations and Restrictions

* Orders must be placed through the API interface
* RPI orders cannot be placed in combination with other special order types
* Minimum order size requirements may apply

## Placing an RPI Order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the New Order endpoint">
    Make a request to the [New Order](https://docs.paradex.trade/api-reference/prod/orders/new) endpoint
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set RPI instruction">
    Set `instruction="RPI"` in your order parameters
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Introduction to Perpetual Options

# What are Perpetual Options?

Perpetual Options are a novel new crypto derivative instrument that combines the risk-reward profile of options (protected downside with unlimited upside) with the simplicity of perpetual futures.

Perpetual options are:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Options that never expire" icon="fa-solid fa-infinity">
    <p class="text-sm">
      Unlike traditional options that have a fixed expiration date, Perpetual Options can be held indefinitely, reducing expiry timing risk
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Continuously funded instruments" icon="fa-solid fa-money-bill-transfer">
    <p class="text-sm">
      Instead of paying a large premium upfront, traders pay (or receive) a continuous funding rate based on market conditions to hold a position
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Simplified derivatives" icon="fa-solid fa-chart-simple">
    <p class="text-sm">
      They follow the same straightforward PnL structure as perpetual futures (entry price, exit price, funding)
    </p>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
  Perpetual Options fit naturally within the derivative framework crypto traders
  know and love (perpetuals) while offering a new way to access leverage without
  taking price-based liquidation risk.
</Tip>

# Why Trade Perpetual Options?

Perpetual options blend the upside of leverage with built‑in downside protection—so you can stay in a trade, without the constant threat of getting liquidated (by price).

In perp options, the extra funding also covers downside protection, so price swings are less deadly. In perp futures, funding simply pays for leverage.

    <Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
      Perpetual Options can be thought of as dated options with a time to expiry equal to their funding period (roughly 24 hours). However, instead of continuously buying new dated options as they expire, the funding mechanism automatically "rolls" your position forward.

# Perpetual Options Explained

Perpetual Options combine features of traditional options with a funding mechanism that allows them to exist without expiration dates.

# Core Concepts

## Option Valuation

The mark price of a Perpetual Option depends on 6 major inputs:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Option Type" icon="fa-solid fa-toggle-on">
    <p class="text-sm">
      Call or Put option
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Spot Oracle Price" icon="fa-solid fa-chart-line">
    <p class="text-sm">
      Current price of the underlying asset
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Strike Price" icon="fa-solid fa-bullseye">
    <p class="text-sm">
      Predetermined price at which the option can be exercised
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Mark Implied Volatility (Mark IV)" icon="fa-solid fa-chart-bar">
    <p class="text-sm">
      Estimated volatility used in price calculations
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Interest Rate" icon="fa-solid fa-percent">
    <p class="text-sm">
      Derived from Paradex Futures Funding Rate
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Funding Period" icon="fa-solid fa-clock">
    <p class="text-sm">
      Set at 24 hours for continuous funding
    </p>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Paradex calculates prices using the Black-Scholes formula adapted for perpetual options with continuous funding.

### Implied Volatiility (IV)

Paradex maintains a Mark Implied Volatility that reflects a fair estimate of market IV even when the perpetual option may be illiquid. Mark IV is derived from 4 inputs:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    "Best bid/ask prices" ||--o{ "Mark IV" : "Internal"
    "Last trade price" ||--o{ "Mark IV" : "Internal"
    "Mid price" ||--o{ "Mark IV" : "Internal"
    "External IV" ||--o{ "Mark IV" : "External"
```

## Time Value

In Perpetual Options, Time Value is the difference between the mark price of the option and its intrinsic value:

$\text{Time Value} = \text{Mark Price} - \text{Intrinsic Value}$

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
  Time Value represents the premium or value traders are willing to pay for the option's potential future value.
</Tip>

## Funding Mechanism

The funding mechanism is how Perpetual Options maintain their perpetual nature. Long positions continuously pay short positions a funding rate based on the option's time value.

* **Funding Period:** 5 days (funding is paid continuously)
* **Funding Premium:** The total amount of funding paid over the funding period, equal to the time value of the option:

  Funding Premium = Time Value = Mark Price - Intrinsic Value

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
  The Funding Period is a critical concept to understand. It represents the expected period of time over which a user will pay the time value of the option via Funding. This is a parameter chosen by Paradex and is what makes the current Perpetual Option similar (but not equal to) a 5-day dated option.
</Tip>

### Example

For a BTC-USD-104000-C with:

* Spot Price: \$100,000
* Mark Price: \$500
* Intrinsic Value: \$0 (out-of-the-money)
* Time Value: \$500

If Dave buys 5 contracts and holds for 8 hours with unchanged prices:

* Funding PnL = -5 × ($500 / 5) * 8/24 = -$166.67

Funding accrues continuously as unrealized PnL and is realized whenever the position is updated.

## Option Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Perpetual Call Options">
    Similar to a traditional dated call option, a Perpetual Call Option gives the holder the right to benefit from price increases above the strike price. The intrinsic value of a Call option is:

    $\text{max}(\text{Spot Price} - \text{Strike Price}, 0)$

    * When Spot Price > Strike Price: The option is "in-the-money" (ITM)
    * When Spot Price \< Strike Price: The option is "out-of-the-money" (OTM)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Perpetual Put Options">
    Similar to a traditional dated put option, a Perpetual Put Option gives the holder the right to benefit from price decreases below the strike price. The intrinsic value of a Put option is:

    $\text{max}(\text{Strike Price} - \text{Spot Price}, 0)$

    * When Spot Price \< Strike Price: The option is "in-the-money" (ITM)
    * When Spot Price > Strike Price: The option is "out-of-the-money" (OTM)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


# Margin Requirements

Paradex currently supports Cross Margin for Perpetual Options, allowing traders to benefit from PnL offsetting across futures and options markets.

<Note>
  Paradex will soon offer 

  **Portfolio Margin**

   which will significantly improve margin requirements for hedged portfolios, particularly for users that are short Perpetual Options.
</Note>

# Cross Margin Parameters

*The parameter values below are examples. The parameters are configurable by the underlying asset.*

| **Fraction Parameter** | **Initial Margin (IMR)** | **Maintenance Margin (MMR)** |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Premium Multiplier     | 100%                     | 50%                          |
| Long ITM Fraction      | 10%                      | 5%                           |
| Short ITM Fraction     | 7.5%                     | 3.75%                        |
| Short OTM Fraction     | 5%                       | 2.5%                         |
| Short Put Cap          | 50%                      | 50%                          |

<Tip title="Core Idea" icon="leaf">
  Cross Margin Requirements for Perpetual Options depend on their type (call/put), moneyness (out-of-money vs in-the money) and the mark price of the Option. Margin requirements vary by underlying asset.
</Tip>

# Margin Calculation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Buying Options">
    Required Margin = min(Premium Multiplier × Option Mark Price, long\_itm × Spot Price)

    The margin plots below show the margin requirements for both call and put options across various strikes ranging from deep out the money (OTM) to in the money (ITM).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Selling Options">
    Required Margin = max(short\_itm × Spot Price - OTM Amount, short\_otm × Spot Price)

    where OTM Amount is:

    * For calls: max(0, Strike Price - Spot Price)
    * For puts: max(0, Spot Price - Strike Price)

    <Note>
      Margin requirements for short put options are capped at short_put_cap × Strike Price to prevent excessively high requirements.
    </Note>

# Pricing

## Pricing Relationship with Dated Options

The price of the perpetual option with continuous funding can be expressed as a continuous sum of dated options, weighted exponentially according to the time to expiry of the dated options :

$$
P_{perpetual}=\frac{1}{T}*\int_0^{\infty}e^{-\frac{\tau}{T}}*P_{dated}(\tau)~d\tau
$$

where $T$ is the funding period of the option

## Pricing Functions

Under Black Scholes, the continuous nature of the option results in closed-form solution for the price (this is not the case in the discrete case) under the assumption that the short-term IV $\sigma$ is flat for a given strike.

The price of a perpetual option depends on :

* Type of the option (call/put)
* $S$ : Spot Price of the underlying asset
* $K$ : Strike Price of the option
* $\sigma$ : The volatility of the underlying asset
* $r$ : The annualised instantaneous interest rate. Paradex derives this from the perpetual future funding rate $\text{FR}$. The relationship is : $r=\frac{1}{T_{Future}}*\frac{\text{FR}}{1+\text{FR}}$
  where $T_{Future}=\frac{8}{24*365}\approx 0.00091324$ corresponds to the 8-hour funding period of the perpetual future
* $T$ : The funding period of the option. Currently set to 5 days, i.e. $T\approx \frac{5}{365}=0.01369863014$

# Mark Implied Volatility

Paradex Mark IV calculation depends on the following prices :

* Orderbook Prices : **Bid Price**, **Ask Price**, **Mid Price**
* **Last Trade Price**
* **External Price** : A perpetual option price estimated using external (Deribit) data

By inverting the [Black Scholes Pricing formula for perpetual options](https://docs.paradex.trade/trading/perpetual-options/pricing#pricing-functions), a variance $\sigma^2$ is implied for each of those 5 prices and smoothed using a 5-minute EWMA for the external variance and 15-second for the internal variances (Ask/Bid/Mid/Last)

The **Mark Variance** is then derived by combining the Variance EWMAs :

$$
\small\text{Mark Variance}=\text{Median}\big(\text{Median}\big(\text{Ask Variance EWMA},~\text{Bid Variance EWMA},~\text{Last Trade Variance EWMA}\big),\\ \text{Mid Variance EWMA},\\ \text{External Variance EWMA}\big)
$$

and Mark IV is finally calculated as the square root of the Mark Variance :

$$
\small\text{Mark IV}=\sqrt{\text{Mark Variance}}
$$

# Automatic Options Listing

### Strike Classification & Listing Rules

Strikes are dynamically classified into three moneyness ranges based on the call delta:

* **ATM (At-the-Money):** Call Delta between 0.40 and 0.60
* **Outer:** Call Delta between 0.20 and 0.40 or between 0.60 and 0.80
* **Wings:** Call Delta below 0.20 or above 0.80

Automatic Listing is triggered for strikes with Call Delta between 0.01 and 0.99. Each moneyness range follows specific strike step sizes depending on the underlying asset:

| **Moneyness** | **BTC** | **ETH** | **SOL** | **HYPE** |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| **ATM**       | \$500   | \$50    | \$5     | \$1      |
| **Outer**     | \$1,000 | \$100   | \$10    | \$2      |
| **Wings**     | \$5,000 | \$500   | \$50    | \$10     |

Options are automatically listed every **8 hours**, at: **00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC, and 16:00 UTC**


# Introduction

## What are Vaults?

Vaults are smart contract-based asset pools in the DeFi ecosystem where
investors deposit collateral assets (currently, only USDC is supported ) and
receive Vault Tokens representing their share.

These pooled assets are managed by Vault Operators who employ trading
strategies—currently focusing on perpetual futures only—to generate returns for
depositors.

## Who should use Vaults?

* An Investor looking for higher yields or returns? -> Become a Vault Depositor
* An Asset Manager looking for more capital base? -> Become a Vault Operator

Discover how vaults are designed to help you achieve financial freedom.

## Benefits for Investors (Vault Depositors)

1. **Access to Professional Trading Strategies**\
   Benefit from experienced vault operators who employ sophisticated strategies across
   various markets.
2. **Potential for Enhanced Returns**\
   Pooling your assets with others allows participation in more scalable trading
   strategies not typically accessible to individual investors.
3. **Greater Diversification of Strategies**\
   Invest your funds across multiple vaults of different risk profiles to achieve
   diversification benefits.
4. **Transparent and Secure Management**\
   Vault operations are governed by smart contracts on the blockchain, providing
   full transparency and allowing you to monitor your assets at any time.

## Benefits for Asset Managers (Vault Owners)

1. **Access to Larger Capital Pools**\
   Manage significant pooled assets from multiple depositors, enabling you to execute
   larger trades and enhance profit potential.
2. **Configurable Parameters**\
   Set profit-sharing percentages between 0% and 20% to attract investors and reward
   your expertise. Operators can configure other parameters like the lockup period
   and the max TVL
3. **Protection of Trading Strategies**\
   The off-chain order book ensures privacy and protects your strategies from being
   compromised by front-running, ensuring trades are executed without external manipulation.
4. **Operational Efficiency**\
   Streamlined vault management with simplified withdrawals and automated processes
   reduces administrative overhead.
5. **Reputation Building**\
   Successfully managing a vault and delivering consistent returns builds credibility,
   attracting more depositors and opening doors within the DeFi ecosystem.


# Key Features

## Types of Vaults

* Protocol Vault
* Community Vaults

## Vault Parameters

*Configurable by the vault owner :*

* Maximum TVL
* Profit Share (between 0% and 20%)
* Lockup Period (between 1 and 4 days)

## Vault Tokens

Depositing into the vault results in minting Vault Tokens for the depositor. The user can monitor the price of this asset which depends on the value of the vault and its total supply in tokens.

Currently, vault tokens do not count as collateral and do not contribute to account value since Paradex does not support multi-collateral yet.

## Withdrawal into Auxiliary Accounts

The process of withdrawing from the vault is designed to be efficient and fair by minimising the impact on other users of the vault.

A share of each position of the vault is moved to an auxiliary account for a unwind. This protects other users of the vault from any unwind cost regardless of market conditions and the withdrawn amount.

The unwind process within the auxiliary account tries to minimise slippage for the withdrawer by gradually closing the positions on the market.

# FAQs

<Accordion title="Can anyone create a Vault?">
  Yes! Anyone can create a Vault as long as you deposit the minimum initial
  owner deposit of \$100.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between a vault owner and a vault operator?">
  A vault owner is the account that controls the vault and receives a share of
  the profits. A vault operator is a specialized account that has access to the
  deposited funds and is responsible for trading to generate returns.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are profits distributed in a vault?">
  Profits are distributed based on the vault's profit share structure. A
  percentage goes to the vault owner, while the rest is distributed among
  depositors proportional to their share in the vault.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long after my deposit can I withdraw my funds?">
  Because withdrawal transactions cannot be performed in the same block as a
  deposit, there is currently around a **5 minute** window where you will not be
  able to withdraw fund immediately after deposit. This is the time that is
  required to created this new block for the withdrawal transaction. Otherwise,
  the time is also limited by the [Lockup
  Period](https://docs.paradex.trade/documentation/vaults/tutorials/vault-withdrawal#note-you-will-not-be-able-to-withdraw-from-the-vault-if-your-minimum-lockup-period-of-not-over-yet)
  that is configured for the Vault. This can be found just above the Deposit
  button with the other Vault status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is the performance of a vault calculated?">
  Vault performance is calculated based on the change in the vault's total value
  over time. This includes trading profits, losses, and any fees incurred.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any fees associated with using vaults?">
  Fees may vary depending on the specific vault. Typically, there's a profit
  share for the vault owner. Always check the vault's details for specific fee
  information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How secure are Paradex Vaults?">
  Paradex Vaults are built with robust security measures, including role-based
  access control and multi-signature approvals. However, as with any DeFi
  product, there are inherent risks, and users should do their own research
  before participating.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I monitor my vault's performance?">
  Paradex provides detailed analytics for vault operations. You can see an
  overview from your Portfolio and also get a more detailed analysis by clicking
  on the vault from the [main vaults page](https://app.paradex.trade/vaults).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will I gain any XP from depositing funds into Vaults?">
  Yes, XP will be awarded to your account on a Weekly basis. Vaults earn Fee,
  Maker, OI, and TVL XP just like any normal accounts. These XP earnt will then
  be distributed to depositors every Friday as Vaults XP. Deposit in Vaults with
  an active XP boost for a higher earn rate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can my vault's PnL be positive but its ROI is negative? (or vice-versa)">
  The ROI is calculated based on the Vault's current token price divided by the initial token price (which is \$1).

  The P\&L and ROI of the Vault could be different due to differences in a Vault's
  TVL at different time periods

  A Vault's P\&L could be positive due to higher returns on a higher TVL base
  (somebody had deposited money in the Vault), but negative in ROI because it had
  negative returns on a smaller TVL base.
</Accordion>

# Limit Order

A limit order is a type of trade order where you specify the price at which you want to buy or sell a security.

Unlike market orders, where trades are executed immediately at the best available prices, limit orders are set to execute only at your specified price or better.

This gives you control over the price, though it doesn't guarantee the order will be executed if the market price never reaches your specified limit. It's a useful tool for traders who prioritize price over immediacy.


# Market Order

A market order is a command to buy or sell an instrument immediately for the full amount requested.

Unlike limit orders, market orders do not specify the price and are executed at the best available prices in the market at the time of the order.

If there are not enough orders at the top of book price for a complete fill, the remaining order amount will fill at the next best price until the entire order has been filled.

While this ensures quick execution, the final execution price may vary, especially in volatile or less liquid markets. Market orders are commonly used when speed of execution is prioritized over price control.

You should only use this order type if you require immediacy in filling your full amount specified, and if you are not sensitive to price slippages.

<Info>
  You will only need to enter the 'Amount' field to submit your buy or sell order.

  A market order will always result in Taker trades.
</Info>


# Scaled Order

# Stop Orders

There are 2 types of Stop Orders: Stop Limit Order, and Stop Market Order.

### Stop Limit Order

Stop Limit Order executes a Limit Order at a specific price after the instrument's Mark Price crosses the Trigger Price. Traders use it to have greater control over the execution price, particularly in volatile markets. They might employ this order to limit losses or protect profits without the risk of slippage associated with stop-loss orders.

However, in fast moving markets, the market may gap over the limit price, which results in the stop being triggered but potentially leaving the limit order unexecuted if the asset's price doesn't return to the limit price.

### Stop Market Order

A Stop Market Order is designed to sell or buy a security when it reaches a specific price, known as the Trigger Price. Once the instrument's Mark Price crosses the Trigger Price, a Market Order would be executed. Traders use this to limit losses or to enter the market at a breakout point.

However, in volatile markets, the execution price can differ significantly from the stop price due to rapid price changes, especially if the market gaps past the stop price, it would execute at the next available price, causing slippages.

TWAP - or Time Weighted Average Price - allows you to split a large order up to be executed over a period of time, so that you fill your orders over an average price.

## How to submit a TWAP order?

1. Select the market that you wish to trade
2. Select "TWAP" under the order types
3. Input the parameters of the TWAP order
   1. **Buy / Sell** - Trade direction
   2. **Size** - Total size of the orders to be submitted
   3. **Hours and Minutes** - Total runtime of the TWAP order

<Info>
  TWAP splits a large order into **Market Orders** submitted over your specified period of time.

# TP/SL

## What is a TP/SL?

A TP/SL order consists of a Take Profit Market trigger order and a Stop Loss Market trigger order. Once one of the order is triggered, the other order will be canceled. Due to this behaviour, TP/SL is also a subset of One-Cancels-Other (OCO) order.

A trader usually has price levels in mind where they want to take profit from a position or stop out of it.

Normally, the trader has to place a Stop Loss order and a Limit order separately. If one of the orders gets filled, they would have to manually cancel the other order themselves, else they risk being filled twice

<Warning>
  Please note that TP/SL creates [<u>Market Orders</u>](./market-order) not Limit Orders!
</Warning>

<details>
  <summary>
    Example: Having separate TP and SL orders
  </summary>

  Trader currently has a Long position of 1 BTC @ \$61,000 and wishes to Take profit at \$62,000 and Stop loss at \$60,000.

  Trader has to place a Limit Sell Order of 1 BTC @ \$62,000 and a Stop Loss order of 1 BTC @ \$60,000 separately.

  If his Limit Sell Order of 1 BTC @ \$62,000 is filled, the Stop Loss order stays opened and the trader has to cancel it himself. He will then have no open BTC position left.

  If he forgets to cancel that remaining Stop Loss order and it gets triggered and filled, then he would end up having short 1 BTC of position.
</details>

This is where TP/SL comes in handy, allowing them to place both orders at the same time, without worrying the need to cancel one of them when the other is filled.

<details>
  <summary>
    Example: Leaving a TP/SL orders
  </summary>

  Trader currently has a Long position of 1 BTC @ \$61,000 and wishes to Take profit at \$62,000 and Stop loss at \$60,000.

  Trader places a TP/SL order with a Take Profit of 1 BTC @ \$62,000 and a Stop Loss of 1 BTC @ \$60,000 in the same order.

  If his Take Profit Order of 1 BTC @ \$62,000 is filled, then the Stop Loss will be automatically be cancelled.

  This makes sure that the trader will have no open BTC position left open.
</details>

# Order Instructions

## Reduce-only

A reduce-only order ensures that any order executed only reduce an existing position, preventing the accidental increase or flipping of the position. Traders would use reduce-only orders to lock in profits or prevent further losses without the risk of unintentionally expanding their market exposure.

A Reduce-only order will be accepted only if it serves to reduce an open position.

When a market order reduces the position size, or a more aggressive limit order is set, the reduce-only order will be canceled, as it no longer serves to reduce the position.

### Minimum Order Value

For reduce-only orders, we will allow users to submit an order that is below the instrument's [minimum order value](./#minimum-order-value) only if the order fully closes an open position (i.e. the size of the reduce-only is equal to the position size).

<Info>
  A 'Reduce-only' order can be placed with any Order Types and Instructions.
</Info>

#### Common Scenarios

<details>
  <summary>
    How does an increase in position affect reduce-only orders?
  </summary>

  When a position was increased by other trades, all existing reduce-only orders will remain unchanged.

  For example:

  * A trader currently has
    * Long 100 ETH position
    * Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 100 ETH @ \$4,500
  * If the trader submits a Market Buy Order of any amount of ETH:
    * the Reduce-only Limit Sell Order remains open.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    How does a reduction in position affect reduce-only orders?
  </summary>

  When a position has been reduced / closed / reversed by other trades, existing reduce-only orders that has an amount greater than the current position will be cancelled.

  Example 1:

  * A trader currently has
    * Long 100 ETH position
    * Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 100 ETH @ \$4,500
  * If the trader submits a Market Sell Order of any amount of ETH:
    * the Reduce-only Limit Sell Order will be cancelled.

  Example 2:

  * A trader currently has
    * Long 100 ETH position
    * Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 60 ETH @ \$4,500
  * If the trader submits a Market Sell Order of 40 ETH or less:
    * the Reduce-only Limit Sell Order remains open.
  * If the trader submits a Market Sell Order of more than 40 ETH:
    * the Reduce-only Limit Sell Order will be cancelled.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    How do Limit Orders affect reduce-only orders?
  </summary>

  For example, a trader currently has:

  * Long 100 ETH position
  * Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 50 ETH @ \$4,500
  * Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 50 ETH @ \$4,600

  Scenario 1: If the trader submits a Limit Sell Order of 1 ETH @ \$4,400

  * the Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 50 ETH @ \$4,500 remains open.
  * the Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 50 ETH @ \$4,600 will be cancelled.

  Scenario 2: If the trader submits a Limit Sell Order of 1 ETH @ \$4,700

  * Both the Reduce-only Limit Sell Orders remains open.
  * The new Limit Sell Order of 1 ETH @ \$4,700 is opened.

  Scenario 3: If the trader submits a Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 1 ETH @ \$4,700

  * The new order (Reduce-only Limit Sell Order of 1 ETH @ \$4,700) will be rejected (cancelled).
</details>

***

## Post-only

A post-only order is a type of limit order that ensures the trader pays only the maker fees and doesn't take liquidity from the market. If such an order would immediately match with an existing order, it gets canceled instead of executed. This ensures the trader's order goes into the order book, maintaining the position of a market maker rather than a taker, thereby benefiting from lower fees and contributing to market liquidity.

<Info>
  Post-only orders

  * Can only be placed with Limit orders and Stop Limit orders.
  * Will always result in Maker trades.
</Info>

***

## Good Till Cancelled (GTC)

A Good Till Cancelled (GTC) order remains active in the market until it's either executed or manually canceled by the trader.

This type of order is beneficial for investors who do not wish to monitor their trades daily but have specific price points at which they wish to buy or sell a security. It ensures that the order will remain rested on the orderbook until it reaches the desired price level or is canceled.

<Info>
  GTC orders

  * Can be used with all order types except Market orders.
  * Can be used with all order instructions except IOC orders.
</Info>

***

## Immediate or Cancel (IOC)

The purpose of an Immediate or Cancel (IOC) order is to ensure immediate execution for as much of an order as possible up to a specified price, with any unfilled part being instantly canceled.

An IOC order is similar but more powerful than a Market Order, because it immediately fills against the orderbook's rested orders, but only for up to a certain price set by the trader. This provides protection to a trader by preventing slippage beyond their specified price.

However, rapid price fluctuations can cause an IOC order to not be fully executed instantly. In such scenarios, the unfilled portion is immediately canceled, potentially leading to no trade if the market moves too swiftly.

<Info>
  IOC orders

  * Can only be used with a Limit Order type.
  * Can be used with Reduce-only, but not with GTC and Post-only.
  * Will always result in Taker trades.
</Info>


# Price Impact and Slippage

## What is Price Impact?

Price impact refers to how much the price of an asset moves due to a trader's order consuming liquidity at various price levels in the order book.

### Mechanism

* An orderbook consists of **limit orders** at various prices. The best available price for a buyer is the lowest ask, and for a seller, it's the highest bid.
* When you place a **market order**, it consumes liquidity starting from the best available price and moves deeper into the order book as necessary to fulfill the order.
* The larger the market order, the more price levels it will sweep, leading to a greater price impact.

***

## What is Slippage?

Slippage is the deviation between the expected price of a trade (based on the top of the orderbook) and the actual average price at which the trade is executed.

### Mechanism

* Slippage occurs due to **price impact** (trading across multiple price levels in the book) and/or **market conditions** like volatility.
* The key factors affecting slippage are:
  1. **Order Size**: Larger orders consume more of the orderbook, resulting in more slippage.
  2. **Market Liquidity**: Thin orderbooks with low volume at each price level exacerbate slippage.
  3. **Volatility**: Rapid price changes during execution can lead to unexpected outcomes.

<Accordion title="Example">
  | Price Level | Ask Price | Ask Size |
  | ----------- | --------- | -------- |
  | 1           | 100,000   | 10       |
  | 2           | 100,010   | 5        |
  | 3           | 100,030   | 10       |

  If I submit a market order of size 20, I will get the following fills :

  * 10 at a price of 100,000
  * 5 at a price of 100,010
  * 5 at a price of 100,030

  The price impact in this case was \$30.

  The average fill price is :

  (100,000 \* 10 + 100,010 \* 5 + 100,030 \* 5) / 20 = 100,010

  So the slippage relative to best ask price was \$10
</Accordion>

***

## How can I minimize my slippage?

* **Limit Orders**:
  * Place [limit orders](./placing-orders/order-types/limit-order) at desired prices to avoid price impact and control slippage.
  * Note: This risks the order not being filled if the market doesn’t reach your limit price.
* **Order Splitting**:
  * Break large orders into smaller chunks and execute them over time to reduce price impact.
  * [TWAP](./placing-orders/order-types/twap-order) (Time-Weighted Average Price) can help to do this in an automated way
* **Use Market Depth**:
  * Analyze the orderbook depth to estimate how much liquidity is available at each price level before placing large orders.
* **Set [Maximum Slippage](./price-impact-and-slippage/slippage)** :
  * Define a maximum acceptable slippage to avoid orders executing at unexpectedly poor prices.


# Changing Max Slippage for an Order

## Max Slippage

**Max slippage** defines the largest acceptable price deviation from the mark price.

If max slippage is not set by the user, default max slippage on market level will apply.
Default max slippage values are as below:

| Instrument   | Leverage            | Max Slippage |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
| PERP         | 50x                 | 0.001        |
| PERP         | 50x > Leverage > 5x | 0.002        |
| PERP         | 5x                  | 0.005        |
| PERP\_OPTION | -                   | 0.5          |

Both market and account defined slippage configurations are ignored for take profit or stop loss orders.

During execution, an order will be canceled if the price exceeds the slippage limit or falls outside the market [Price Bands](https://docs.paradex.trade/documentation/risk-system/price-bands).

***

## How to Update Max Slippage

1. Navigate to the **Trade** section of the UI

2. Locate the **Order** section, and click on the Max Slippage value

<Frame>
  <img src="file:1e2ae3a0-8a6c-4827-9107-9f9b260434a9" alt="" />
</Frame>

3. Some markets have max cap of slippage percentage (In this case BTC-USD-PERP has max slippage of 2%)

<Frame>
  <img src="file:37b0f2be-ff29-430f-9bae-86ca2bdb2d93" alt="" />
</Frame>

4. Adjust the slippage tolerance to your preferred percentage. You can use decimals as well as long as it is within max slippage of each market, example : 0.5% works since it is below 2% for BTC-USD-PERP.

# Account Privacy

> We believe that financial privacy is a fundamental right.

<Note>
  Account Privacy is currently in Alpha. During this time, existing RPC nodes without privacy protection will remain publicly accessible.
</Note>

Our off-chain orderbook hides order data from the public.
However, since account data are stored on-chain, additional methods are needed to provide privacy to users.

We are taking a phased approach to Account Privacy, rolling out stronger privacy with each phase.

1. Full Position Privacy through RPC Masking ✅
2. Permanent Privacy through Encrypted DA
3. Privacy secured at the Smart Contract level

## How Privacy Works Today

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Masked by Default" icon="fa-regular fa-mask">
    Account data is hidden from others
  </Card>

  <Card title="Authentication Reveals your Data" icon="fa-regular fa-key-skeleton">
    You can access your own data when authenticated with your private key
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Privacy protection lasts \~6 hours until data is submitted to L1. Future phases will provide permanent privacy.

# Self Trade Prevention

The implementation of our Self-Trade Prevention (STP) feature enables users trading all instruments via API to configure an STP parameter for their orders. This feature effectively mitigates unintentional self-trading as **self-trading through the same account is not possible**.

With this parameter, users have the flexibility to determine the outcome in case of a self-trade, whether to expire the maker order, the taker order, or both orders.

## Self-Trade Prevention Function for API Users

There are three distinct modes for the STP function, more details

1. EXPIRE\_MAKER : close the resting order
2. EXPIRE\_TAKER (Default): close the aggressive order
3. EXPIRE\_BOTH : close both

More details on how to use STP function, please refer to [API doc](https://docs.api.testnet.paradex.trade/#get-open-orders)


# Receive Window

The `recv_window` parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the signature timestamp is valid  after the submission time. If not specified, this is currently set to 3600000 ms (1hr) by default.

`Condition : If current_time > recv_window + signature_time → reject the order`


# Wallet Overview

Users are able to deposit and withdraw their funds on Paradex via the native bridge or our cross-chain bridge partners. Starknet wallets are also supported via our cross-chain bridging partners.

## **Native Bridge**

Our native Paradex bridge, StarkGate, provides a trust-less route for users to transfer assets between Ethereum and Paradex. This ensures a seamless and secure transaction process. *(See* [*Deposits & Withdrawals*](deposits-and-withdrawals/ethereum-wallets) *for more info)*

## **Cross-Chain Bridge**

We have partnered with [Rhino.fi](http://rhino.fi/) and [Layerswap](https://layerswap.io/) to offer alternative flows for onboarding to Paradex. These partnerships ensure that onboarding is seamless, secure, and user-friendly, allowing users to easily fund their accounts with USDC. Bridge partners can offer fast transfer times and competitive fees with optimized gas usage, resulting in lower costs.

<Info>
  Our app only displays available bridge paths between source and destination chains. For example — Rhino.fi does not currently support Non-EVM to Non-EVM bridge transfers (ie: Solana, Starknet -> Paradex)
</Info>

## Starknet Wallets

We have extended key generation to Starknet accounts, enabling your connected Starknet wallet to [deterministically derive a Paradex Account](../getting-started/architecture-overview/wallet-integration). Deposits and withdrawals on Starknet Wallets would be done via our [Cross Chain Bridging](deposits-and-withdrawals/cross-chain-bridging).

## Email and Social Wallets

Email or Social wallets are a simple way to get an Ethereum account without having to manage it yourself. They are secured by [Privy](https://www.privy.io/).

## Accepted Collateral

Paradex currently supports USDC as collateral to fund margin obligations. Plans are in place to transition to a multi-collateral model in the future, where Paradex will accept various cryptocurrencies, each adjusted for specific risk levels.

## Transfer and TVL Limits

Please be aware of the following limits:

* <span>**Maximum Deposit per Transaction:**</span> 500,000 USDC
* <span>**Maximum Total Value Locked (TVL):**</span> 50 million USDC across all users

These limits are designed to manage risk and ensure platform stability.

## [Guardian Keys](../security/guardian-keys)

You may also use a [Guardian Key](../security/guardian-keys) to safeguard your withdrawals. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/tradeparadex/paradex-cli/wiki/Tutorial:-Hardening-Account-Security).


# Ethereum Wallets

> Detailed guide for depositing and withdrawing funds to / from Paradex

## Deposits

Initiate a deposit from your Ethereum wallet to the Starknet bridge and it will automatically be sent to Paraclear. These transactions may take several minutes depending on network conditions.

<img src="file:cce9c389-f397-479c-88ad-56ca28849a0f" alt="" />

**Initiate a Deposit to the Paradex Bridge**

1. Navigate to the **“**[**Portfolio**](https://app.paradex.trade/portfolio)**”** tab in the webapp and connect your wallet (MetaMask or other supported wallet)
2. Click the <span>**“Deposit”**</span> button and enter the amount of funds you wish to transfer to Paradex.

<Info>
  Note: This action will require 1-2 L1 signatures. If this is your first deposit to Paradex you will need to enable ERC-20 token transfers and set a spending cap for USDC to the Paradex bridge. If you already have an allowed spending limit set for this token, you can skip this step.
</Info>

3. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask to send USDC to the Paradex bridge contract by selecting <span>**“Initiate Deposit to Bridge”.**</span>
4. Wait for L1 Confirmation:
   * Wait for the L1 deposit transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain. This may take a few minutes depending on network conditions.
   * Once confirmed, your funds will automatically be sent from the bridge to Paraclear
5. Start Trading!

## Withdrawals

Initiate a withdrawal from your Paradex account to the Starknet bridge and it will automatically be sent to your L1 once it is available.

<img src="file:88f54f58-0cd6-4ae0-841b-7c39196464a1" alt="" />

**Initiate a Withdrawal to the Paradex Bridge**

1. Navigate to the **“**[**Portfolio**](https://app.paradex.trade/portfolio)**”** tab in the webapp and connect your wallet (MetaMask or other supported wallet)
2. Click the <span>**“Withdraw”**</span> button and enter the amount of funds you wish to transfer from Paradex.
3. Click <span>**“Initiate Withdrawal to Bridge”**</span>.
4. Wait for L1 Confirmation:
   * Wait for the L1 withdrawal transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain. Once confirmed, the deposit status will update to <span>**“Available - L1”**</span> in the “Deposit / Withdrawals” table.
   * Once funds are available on L1, we will complete the transfer of your funds from the bridge to your wallet automatically.

<Warning>
  Note: "Pending - L2" status can take up to 8 hours to update. You can check for historical averages by going to the Liveness section of the [Paradex's L2BEAT page](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/paradex#liveness) and selecting the `State Updates` tab.

  Withdrawing funds requires all preceding actions from all accounts (including risk checks) be validated on Ethereum (L1). Your Paradex (L2) withdrawal transaction will be batched along with other Paradex (L2) transactions (trades, deposits, withdrawals, etc) and sent to the Starknet Prover to generate a Proof guaranteeing the calculations. Batching and proving can take several hours depending on the volume of trades / transactions processed by Paradex (L2) and generating a Starknet proof takes around 2 hours. Once the proof is generated it is sent to the Starknet (L1) verifier contract which will confirm its validity and then unlock funds for withdrawal.
</Warning>

5. Withdrawal complete!


# Starknet Wallets

Your Paradex account lives on the Paradex chain, separate from the public Starknet ecosystem. To support Starknet ecosystem users, we have extended our [wallet integration](../../getting-started/architecture-overview/wallet-integration). This ensures seamless integration and secure access for users transitioning between Paradex and Starknet. Funding of your Paradex account from a Starknet Wallet must be done via our [Cross Chain Bridging partners](cross-chain-bridging).

## Supported Accounts

Starknet accounts are smart contracts that allow users to change their underlying signer. Paradex relies on deterministic ECDSA signatures to generate your Paradex private key. We have added checks to ensure account type compatibility before onboarding.

<Warning>
  Changing the signer can result in an inability to generate the same private key for your account. We recommend users back up their Paradex private key to ensure secure access to their accounts.
</Warning>

# Email and Social Wallets

Email and Social wallets allow you to have an Ethereum account without having to manage the wallet yourself.

We understand that, as an email or social wallet user, you might want to transfer funds from/to centralized exchanges. You can do that via our [cross-chain bridge](./cross-chain-bridging) partner Layerswap.

See the steps below:

## Deposits

How to transfer USDC from a centralized exchange to Paradex:

1. If you haven't yet, go to the exchange website and buy USDC;
2. On the exchange website, look for an option to withdraw USDC;
3. Select a network through which you want to make the transfer;
4. You will be asked an address, which we will get below;
5. Go to Paradex and click *Deposit*;
6. Select the same network you selected before;
7. Select Layerswap as the bridge;
8. Click *Continue to Layerswap*;
9. On Layerswap, click *Connect Wallet* and then *Continue without a wallet*;
10. Click *Swap now*;
11. You will be given an address to transfer to;

  Direct transferring of funds from a Public Starknet Wallet to your Paradex Address is not supported and will result in a loss of fund.
</Warning>


# Wallet Integration

## **Paradex Integration**

Paradex, a [Starknet Appchain](starknet-first-appchain), incorporates separate public/private keys from your connected wallet (ie: Ethereum L1). To interact with Paradex, here's a simplified overview:

1. **Key Generation**: visit the Paradex UI running in your browser. When you sign the Onboarding message, it will deterministically generate your private Paradex keys based on a signature from your connected wallet. Wallets that support deterministic signing are supported. Importantly, this process ensures that you can regenerate your Paradex keys using the same connected wallet. Your Paradex keys are never transmitted to Paradex servers or any external location; they remain securely stored in your browser.
2. **Transaction Signing**: Your private Paradex key is employed to sign any transactions you authorize on Layer 2. The UI running on your machine automatically performs these signatures when required.
3. **Starknet Wallets (Beta)**: We're extending our key generation flow to support wallets from Starknet, including [Argent X](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/argent-x/dlcobpjiigpikoobohmabehhmhfoodbb) and [Braavos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/braavos-wallet/jnlgamecbpmbajjfhmmmlhejkemejdma). This will allow users coming from the Starknet ecosystem to trade on Paradex. We're working on a deeper integration with our wallet partners to eventually store keys directly within the wallet itself, offering enhanced security compared to browser storage.

## Paradex internal wallet

### Why did we decide to build a Paradex wallet internal to our app?

We wanted to provide our clients with the simplest possible onboarding experience. Our solution was to allow our customers to operate on Paradex while only having to care about their Ethereum wallet, which they are already familiar with. We did not want users to have to manage a separate Paradex wallet, but instead be able to use a wallet they are comfortable with, such as MetaMask. This reduces complexity, as they would have to manage an Ethereum wallet anyway in order to interact with Paradex.

<Frame caption="MetaMask was our wallet of choice that would allow us to provide a simple experience to our users.">
  <img src="file:b252ba75-b6c7-4ff5-a85e-319703e7dd97" alt="" />
</Frame>

### How the internal wallet works

#### How the Paradex private key is generated

Remember that in order to make changes to the blockchain, the transaction doing so must be signed by a private key and that private key must belong to the user and to the user only.

So how do we generate the same private key to the same user over and over?

I'll answer that with a question: What's the one thing that a MetaMask user can do that we can verify that only they and no one else have done?

The answer: A signature!

Why a signature?

1. It's based off of the user's private key on Ethereum, which in turn is based off of the recovery phrase provided to them by MetaMask, which we know can be used to recreate the wallet on a different device, therefore allowing the same private key to sign on different devices.
2. Only the user is capable of generating that signature given that they are (presumably) the only holder of that private key.

But it's not just any signature.

We need the user to be able to generate the exact same signature over and over otherwise, again, they will lose their funds. The way we do that is by always asking the user to sign the same thing every time.

There we have it: some bytes that only the user themself can generate repeatedly in any device that they choose to use.

#### How the Paradex private key is generated based off of an Ethereum signature?

This is where some slightly advanced cryptography comes in.

The signature itself can't be the user's private key on Paradex because the private key must be compatible with a [Stark-friendly elliptic curve](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex/crypto/stark-curve.html).

<img src="file:8434b5c0-b3a2-44ce-b0ad-aacac7e7b87e" alt="" />

Converting arbitrary inputs into a private key is done with a KDF or [Key Derivation Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function). The KDF takes the input and does a series of transformations to it in order to convert it to a key in a deterministic way.

Of course we relied on the StarkWare team as the cryptography specialists to provide us with the KDF that would do what we needed in a secure way.

Finally, this gave us the key (no pun intended) to allow our users to interact with Paradex by only having a MetaMask wallet.

#### How the Paradex private key is stored

You must be asking yourself how secure is this private key, right?

It's as secure as the user's computer. The private key never leaves RAM and is sandboxed to the browser tab running the app. This means that only the user's machine can sign transactions on Paradex and only while that machine is running. It's not stored anywhere else and is never sent in a request. The moment the app closed the private key goes away.

#### How is “remember me” possible?

If “Remember Me” is checked when connecting the wallet, the Ethereum Signature used to derive the Paradex private key is stored in the browser's Local Storage. As with the private key, this signature never leaves the user's browser, but allows the user to automatically authenticate on loading the app without requiring interactions with their wallet. Users can opt-out of the Remember Me feature during Sign-In (Connect Wallet), so that the Ethereum Signature is not stored in the user's browser Local Storage.

#### Clock Synchronization

You should update the date and time on your device to be set automatically, to avoid issues when signing requests (e.g. during Onboarding/Authentication).\
See [MacOS documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2996/mac) or [Windows documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-set-your-time-and-time-zone-dfaa7122-479f-5b98-2a7b-fa0b6e01b261)

<Warning>
  The L1 wallet you connect during onboarding is permanently linked to your Paradex L2 account and cannot be updated later.

  If you want to operate with a different L1 wallet, you will need to create a new Paradex account.
</Warning>

# Sub-Accounts

Users could create a Sub-Accounts with a separate L2 Wallet Address that linked to a main account. The sub-account has all the same functionality as a main account.

## Why use a Sub-Account?

Users could create a Sub-Account to trade on a separate account so that:

* Positions could be managed separately
* Margin is shielded from the main account and other accounts
* Liquidation will not affect the collateral kept in other accounts.

## How to create a sub-account

**Step 1:** Under the 'Account' button on the top right corner, click on 'Switch Account'.

<img src="file:d805d8e8-0837-41b2-b5b0-930b2266e70b" alt="" />

**Step 2:** On the 'Switch Account' pop-up, click on 'Add Account'.

<img src="file:7ded0cc7-d69a-460d-8c3f-7795b53f0b71" alt="" />

**Step 3:** Click on the newly created Sub-Account to enter it.

## Via API

Should for any reason you need to transfer funds from your current Paradex Wallet to a different Paradex Wallet via API, you are also able to leverage Starknet APIs do this. Feel free to use [this script](https://github.com/tradeparadex/code-samples/blob/main/python/transfer_l2_usdc.py) to do so or as a reference should you want to build your own.


# Mobile Access Guide

> Paradex offers two ways to access the platform on your mobile device.

<Info>
  If you are not using email or social logins for your Paradex account, you will need your wallet mobile app installed on your device to login.

  If your wallet does not offer mobile apps (eg. Rabby), you will not be able to use our Paradex mobile app. We are actively working on alternative login methods for this use case.

# API Authentication

> Authenticate directly with the Paradex API

API keys allow you to interact with the Paradex trading system programmatically without using the web interface.
This guide covers how to generate and manage different types of credentials for trading, monitoring, and API access.

There are 2 general types of credentials used to authenticate with the Paradex API

1. JWT Tokens - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are secure tokens that contain encoded information about your permissions. They grant access to most API endpoints that are non-public and are included in every request to the API.
2. Private Keys - Grant full trading access. Private keys are used both for creating JWT Tokens and Signatures, which are both sent to the API to place orders.

<img src="file:cd5043c3-40a0-43fc-82b0-20a93d0fe119" alt="Auth Credentials" />

## Full Trading Access

In order to enable full trading access via API, users need to export a Private Key associated with their account.
This can either be:

1. Main Private Key
2. [Subkey](#subkeys)

Please refer to the SDK documentation on how to use your Private key to interact with on Paradex via API.

* [paradex-py](https://github.com/tradeparadex/paradex-py)
* [paradex-js](https://github.com/tradeparadex/paradex.js)

<Info>
  For detailed API documentation, see our [API Reference](/developer-portal/general-information/api-reference).
</Info>

### Private Keys

The account's Private key can be obtained on the UI on the Wallet tab

<img src="file:8ecdd622-942c-4af3-b862-c344ccc497a3" alt="Wallet Modal" width="400" />

Click on 'Copy Private Key' to obtain your account's main private key.

<Warning>
  Access to the Main Private Key grants the ability to Withdraw and Transfer funds from the user's account. This should never be exposed.
  For a safer alternative, use Subkeys.
</Warning>

### Subkeys

Subkeys are private keys for an account with scoped down permissions. Unlike your main private key, Subkeys
do not have permissions to perform Withdrawals, Transfers, and manage sensitive account settings.

However, as private keys, they are still fully capable of creating/modifying orders and interacting with the API.

These keys provide a secure way to delegate trading permissions while maintaining control over account security.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Trading Permissions" icon="fa-regular fa-chart-line">
    Can place and manage orders
  </Card>

  <Card title="Restricted Transfers" icon="fa-regular fa-ban">
    Cannot withdraw funds or transfer to other accounts
  </Card>

  <Card title="Account Isolation" icon="fa-regular fa-shield">
    Operate within specific account parameters
  </Card>

  <Card title="Enhanced Security" icon="fa-regular fa-lock">
    Separate from main account private key
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Subkeys Can">
    * Place buy and sell orders
    * Cancel existing orders
    * Modify order parameters
    * Access account balance and positions
    * View order history and trade data
    * Access market data and pricing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subkeys Cannot">
    * Withdraw funds from the account
    * Transfer funds to other accounts
    * Modify account settings
    * Manage Subkeys
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Use Cases

* **Programmatic Trading**: Trade via API without risk of exposing your main Private Key.
* **Automated trading bots**: Deploy trading strategies without full account access
* **Third-party integrations**: Allow trusted applications to trade on your behalf
* **Team trading**: Enable multiple team members to trade with controlled permissions

#### Creating Subkeys

1. Navigate to account security settings and locate Key Management
2. Click on the 'Subkeys' toggle, then click on '+ Add New Key'

<img src="file:9eb143b4-ca55-489b-a9d1-2c4639e495a2" alt="Create New Subkey" />

3. Give your subkey a name
4. Generate and securely store your subkey private key. The private key is not stored on the server and will only be shown once.
5. The public key component can be copied on the Subkeys tab. This public key can also be derived from the private key.
6. To revoke a Subkey, click on the Delete button next to the token on the Subkeys tab

#### Using Subkeys

Subkeys behave like regular private keys. They are used for

* Getting JWT Tokens from the `/auth/:public_key` [endpoint](api/general-information/authentication)
* Signing requests to [create/modify orders](/api/prod/orders/new)

#### Generating Auth Tokens

While using a subkey:

* The Subkey's public key must be provided to the auth endpoint `/auth/{public_key}`
* The `PARADEX-STARKNET-ACCOUNT` header should be the address of the main account
* The `PARADEX-STARKNET-SIGNATURE` must be generated by signing using the subkey private key.

<Note>
  The main account address is required because subkeys are randomly generated keypairs registered to your account. Since we cannot derive the account address from a subkey's private key, we must specify which account the subkey belongs to.
  Additionally, we need to specify the subkey's public key so it can be used for signature verification instead of defaulting to the main account's public key.
</Note>

## Readonly Access

In order to query most APIs with account related information, a JWT Token needs to be attached to the auth headers of the request.

### Readonly Tokens

Readonly Tokens are special JWT Tokens with extended expiry dates.
Readonly tokens provide secure, read-only access to your account data and market information. These tokens are ideal for building monitoring dashboards, creating trading analytics tools, implementing risk management systems, and developing market data applications.

Since these are JWT tokens, they do not grant trading access. They are also restricted to GET requests and cannot be used to modify account information.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Read-only Access" icon="fa-regular fa-eye">
    Cannot place orders or modify account settings
  </Card>

  <Card title="Revocable" icon="fa-regular fa-trash">
    Can be revoked at any time for security
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Permissions

Readonly tokens can access most GET endpoints on the API, including:

* Real-time portfolio monitoring and balance information
* Order history and execution status
* Market data and pricing information
* P\&L tracking and trade execution details

<Note>
  While JWT Tokens have reduced scope, they should still be stored securely and should be rotated regularly.
</Note>

### Creating Readonly Tokens

1. Navigate to account settings and locate the Key Management Section
2. While on the 'Read-only' tab, click "+ Add New Key"

<img src="file:c5ccc5c8-b18a-4689-9868-bd18f4097e8c" alt="Create Readonly Key" />

3. Configure key settings (name and expiration)
4. Generate and securely store your API key. Note that this key will only be shown to you once and cannot be recovered after.
5. To revoke a Readonly token, click on the Delete button next to the token on the Read-only tab

### Using Readonly Tokens

Readonly tokens can be used just like regular auth tokens in API calls to the platform:

Use your newly generated API token in GET requests to the API

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/balance" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <READONLY-TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Summary

Paradex offers three main types of API credentials:

* **Readonly Tokens**: Provide read-only access to account data and market information
* **Subkeys**: Private keys with trading permissions but restricted from withdrawals and transfers
* **Paradex Private Key**: This is your account's main private key. Users with this credential have full access to all account features.

These credentials all enable programmatic access to the Paradex API.

# Advanced API Trader Best Practices

> Essential technical guidelines for advanced traders using the Paradex API to optimize trading performance, manage rate limits, and implement efficient liquidity provision strategies.

## Batch Order Operations

**Efficiency Multiplier:** Single batch request = 1 rate limit unit (regardless of 1-50 orders). Use `POST /orders/batch` and `DELETE /orders/batch` for 50x efficiency improvement vs individual operations.

**Implementation:** Batch operations support partial failures - individual order rejections won't block others. Process response arrays to handle mixed success/failure scenarios. All orders validated by risk engine independently.

<Tip>
  Reference: [Orders API Documentation](https://docs.paradex.trade/api/prod/orders/batch)
</Tip>

## Real-Time BBO Feeds

**WebSocket Channel:** `bbo.{market_symbol}` provides immediate best bid/offer updates with no artificial throttling. Event-driven updates only when price/size changes - use sequence numbers for message ordering.

**Feed Selection:** BBO is optimal for price-only strategies and useful when subscribing to snapshot books. For fastest BBO price changes, use BBO feed directly. For fastest full orderbook depth, subscribe to deltas websocket feed instead.

**Multi-Market Strategy:** Subscribe to BBO feeds for all trading markets simultaneously. Each subscription costs minimal resources and provides real-time pricing for optimal execution decisions.

<Tip>
  Reference: [WebSocket API Documentation](https://docs.paradex.trade/ws/general-information)
</Tip>

## Rate Optimization

**Order Management:** `POST /orders` and `DELETE /orders` share 800 req/s limit pool. Batch operations consume 1 unit regardless of order count (1-50), providing significant efficiency gains for market makers.

**Client ID Optimization:** Avoid using client IDs on orders when possible to reduce processing overhead. Only include client IDs when order tracking is essential for your strategy.

**Signing Optimization:** Order signing is computationally expensive. Pre-sign static order components and only process variable parts (price, size, timestamp) for each new order to reduce latency in high-frequency scenarios.

<Tip>
  Reference: [Rate Limits Documentation](https://docs.paradex.trade/api/general-information/rate-limits/api)
</Tip>

## WebSocket Rate Management

**Connection Limits:** 20 connections/second, 600 connections/minute per IP. Maintain persistent connections rather than frequent reconnects for optimal performance.

**Channel Strategy:** Subscribe to essential channels only: `bbo.{market}`, `fills.{market}`, `positions`, `order`. Avoid unnecessary subscriptions that consume bandwidth.

**Message Processing:** Drain WebSocket messages quickly to prevent disconnection. Exchange will disconnect if 2000+ messages accumulate unprocessed. Implement fast message handling and avoid blocking operations in message callbacks.

**Reconnection Logic:** Implement robust reconnection with backoff that respects rate limits (20 connections/second, 600/minute). Queue critical operations during reconnection to avoid data loss.

<Tip>
  Reference: [WebSocket Rate Limits](https://docs.paradex.trade/ws/general-information/rate-limits)
</Tip>

## Latency Monitoring

**Timestamp Analysis:** Use order response timestamps to monitor network latency for both REST and WebSocket. Track `published_at`, `received_at`, `created_at`, `last_updated_at` fields to identify bottlenecks in your trading pipeline.

## System State Monitoring

**Operational Status:** Poll `GET /v1/system/state` to monitor exchange operational state. Handle three status values: `ok` (fully operational), `maintenance` (trading unavailable), `cancel_only` (only cancellations allowed).

**Implementation Strategy:** Check system state before trading operations and adapt behavior accordingly. During `cancel_only` periods, halt new order submissions but continue order cancellations to manage risk.


# Margin System

> Understanding Paradex's margin modes and risk management

## Margin Modes

Paradex offers two distinct margin modes to accommodate different trading strategies:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Cross Margin" icon="c" href="/risk/cross-margin-requirement">
    Margin shared across all positions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Isolated Margin" icon="i">
    Margin based on individual positions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Instrument Types

All instruments are quoted and valued in USD.

Paradex currently supports only USDC as a collateral asset. You have to deposit USDC on your wallet to trade and all PnL accrued or charged to your wallet will be in USDC.

## Margin Checks

Paradex performs two critical margin checks to ensure platform stability and protect against market manipulation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Margin Check">
    Validates that an account can take additional risk. Examples of when this check is performed:

    * Submitting new orders
    * Requesting withdrawals that would increase account leverage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Maintenance Margin Check">
    Determines if an account is approaching bankruptcy.

    <Error title="If an account fails this check">
      Account positions and balances will be liquidated
    </Error>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Margin Checks Work

All margin checks follow a simple comparison formula:

```
Account Value ≥ Margin Requirement
```

| Component              | Cross Margin                                                                                                                                | Isolated Margin                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Account Value**      | Sum of<br />• USD Collateral (USDC balance)<br />• Unrealized PnL from all positions<br />• Benefits from PnL offsetting across positions   | Position Value only                                                       |
| **Margin Requirement** | Based on<br />• All open positions<br />• Exchange-level parameters<br />• [Cross Margin Requirement](cross-margin-requirement) methodology | Based on<br />• Individual position only<br />• Exchange-level parameters |

For detailed calculations of Account Value and related risk metrics, see the [Margin Term Reference](margin-term-reference).


# Margin Term Reference

## **Definitions**

### ***Position Notional (USD)*** :

Theoretical worth of a position in a derivative asset in USD terms :

$$
\text{Position Notional}=\text{Position Size}*\text{Mark Price}
$$

### ***Collateral Value (USD)***

This is the value of all tokens on account **in USD terms**.

$$
\text{Total Collateral Value}=\text{USDC Balance}*\text{USDC Oracle Price}
$$

### ***Position Cost (USDC)***

Only applies to synthetic balances. Represents the position entry cost - amount of USDC that account paid/received from entering the position. Updated on every trade that account executes in this position. The cost is constant in USDC terms between trades.

$$
\text{Position Cost}=\text{Position Size}*\text{Average Entry Price}
$$

where $\text{Position Cost}$ is a signed number and $\text{Average Entry Price}$ is expressed in USDC

* **Example 1 :** long position of 1 ETH-USD-PERP bought at \$2,000 with USDC/USD=1 has average entry price of 2,000 USDC and position cost of 2,000 USDC.
* **Example 2 :** short position of 1 ETH-USD-PERP sold at \$2,000 with USDC/USD=0.8 has average entry price of 2,500 USDC and position cost of -2,500 USDC.

### ***Accrued Funding (USD)***

This refers to the unrealized Funding *accrued on open perpetual positions since accounts last trade in those positions*. When the account executes a trade in an existing open perpetual position, any accrued funding on this position is realized (i.e. accounts USDC balance is updated) and Funding PnL of this position is reset to 0. For more details on funding mechanism, please refer to the [Funding Mechanism](funding-mechanism) page

### ***Unrealized PnL (USD)***

Unrealized PnL on a derivative asset position determines how much money an account will receive if the corresponding position is closed at mark price :

$$
\begin{align*}
& \underline{\textbf{Unrealized PnL}}= \\
& \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} \bigg(\small\text{Position Notional}(D_j)-\small\text{Position Cost}(D_j)*\small\text{USDC Oracle Price}+\small\text{Accrued Funding}(D_j)\bigg)
\end{align*}
$$

where $D_j,~j\in[1..m]$ are derivative assets where the account has an open position

### ***Account Value (USD)***

Also called margin balance. This value is a key component in margin checks and represents the accounts token assets value in USD if we close all open positions at their mark (fair) price.

$$
\text{Account Value}=\text{Collateral Value}+\text{Unrealized PnL}
$$

### ***Margin Requirement***

* ***Account Initial Margin Requirement (USD) -*** When submitting a new order, the account is subject to a minimum value defined by the initial margin requirement. Note that the cloud and the chain calculate different initial margin requirements for an account :

  * Account IMR (including open orders) - This is calculated off-chain (on cloud) and incorporates both open positions and open/pending orders.
  * Position IMR (only including open positions) - This is calculated on-chain for validation of incoming trades.

  Note that the Account IMR calculated off-chain is more conservative than the Position IMR. Therefore, orders submitted from the cloud to the chain are very unlikely to be rejected.
* ***Account Maintenance Margin Requirement (USD)*** - The MMR is the minimum account value required for the account not to be available for liquidation

*Note :* Calculation of IMR and MMR in a cross-margin account can be found in the [Cross Margin Requirement](cross-margin-requirement) page

### ***Free Collateral Balance (USD)***

The USD value of the collateral that can be immediately withdrawn subject to an upper bound of the user's Account USDC Balance.

$$
\text{Free Collateral Balance} = \text{min}(\text{Account Value} - \text{Account Initial Margin Requirement}, \text{Account USDC Balance})
$$

### ***Account USDC Balance***

Account USDC Balance is equal to the user's net USDC deposits (deposits - withdrawals) + realized PnL (including funding) - fees paid.

### ***Margin Ratio (%)***

This ratio compares the account value to the maintenance margin requirement. If the factor is above 1, the user account is under liquidation mode.

$$
\text{Margin Ratio}=\frac{\text{Maintenance Margin Requirement}}{\text{Account Value}}
$$


# Paradex Risk Checks

## Order Risk Check

### Order Risk Check Conditions

An order is accepted if :

* The account meets the [Initial Margin Requirement](margin-term-reference#margin-requirement) after including the new order, i.e. $\text{Account Value}\ge\text{Account Initial Margin Requirement}$
* Including the order does not result in an increase of the Initial Margin Requirement

### Example

Setup :

* Alice has **100 USD** worth of collateral and uses Cross Margin mode
* $\text{Mark Price}_\text{ XYZ-USD-PERP}=100$

Alice successfully submits a buy XYZ-USD-PERP order of size 10

Assuming [Initial Margin Fraction](cross-margin-requirement#margin-fractions) (IMF) of 10% (i.e. a maximum leverage of 10x), the Initial Margin Requirement is : $10\%*10*100=100~\text{USD}$

Alice has no open position and therefore has an [Account Value](margin-term-reference#account-value-usd) of 100 USD. The order is then accepted since the account meets the IMR condition.

Price drop :

The Mark Price of XYZ-USD-PERP drops to 98.

$\text{Account IMR}=10\%*10*98=98~\text{USD}$

$\text{Unrealized PnL}=10*(98-100)=-20~ \text{USD}$

$\text{Account Value}=100-20=80~\text{USD} < \text{Account IMR}$

Although Alice's account value is below IMR, deleveraging check does not monitor the account since it has no open orders

Submission of an offsetting order :

Alice submits a sell order of size 5. Since this is an offsetting order which is smaller than the position size, it does not increase the [Open Size](cross-margin-requirement#open-sizes) therefore does not increase the Account IMR. The order is **accepted**.

Submission of another order that brings the total sell orders size above the position size

Later, Alice submits a new sell order of size 8. This is also an offsetting order but it does result in an increase in Alice's XYZ-USD-PERP Open Size from 10 to 13. Therefore, this order increases the account IMR. Since the account also does not meet IMR, this order is rejected.

## Health Check

Health Check is a periodic check on account's [Margin Ratio](margin-term-reference#margin-ratio). This check is done once every 5 seconds. An account passes the health check if its account value is positive and the margin ratio is below 100%.

If an account's $\text{Margin Ratio}>\text{100\%}$, the account will enter [Liquidation](liquidations).

## Withdrawal Check

The maximum amount of USDC you can withdraw is determined by your [Free Collateral Balance](margin-term-reference#free-collateral-balance-usd), but is capped by your [Account USDC Balance](margin-term-reference#account-usdc-balance). In other words, you can withdraw up to your Free Collateral Balance in USDC, but never more than the total USDC you currently have in your account.

$$
\small\text{Withdrawable USDC Amount}=\min\Bigg(\text{Account USDC Balance} ,~\max\Big(0, \frac{\text{Free Collateral Balance}}{\text{USDC Oracle Price}}\Big)\Bigg)
$$


# Mark Price Calculation

## **Perpetual Mark Price Formula**

The mark price of a perpetual future instrument is calculated as :

$$
\text{Mark Price}=\text{Spot Oracle Price}*(1+\text{Fair Basis})
$$

where :

$\text{Spot Oracle Price}$ is an external oracle price of the underlying coin obtained via the [Pyth](https://pyth.network/price-feeds) & [Stork](https://www.stork.network/) Networks.

The Fair Basis is calculated as the median of three components:

* median between the EWMA of 3 rates implied from the best bid, best ask and last price
* EWMA of implied the Mid Rate
* median of External Rates

$$
\begin{align*}
\\
&\text{\underline{\large Fair Basis}}= \\
\\
&\text{median}\Bigl(\text{median(Paradex EWMA rates)}, \text{Mid Rate EWMA, median(External Rates)} \Bigr)
\\
\\
\end{align*}
$$

More details are provided below.

## **Steps to calculate the Fair Basis and the Mark Price**

### 1. Every 5 seconds, get the latest Best Ask, Best Bid, Last Trade and Spot Prices

<Frame caption="Example with SOL-USD-PERP best bid, best ask, last trade price and spot price">
  <img src="file:75a27001-6974-4398-8b22-97b4b319ec39" alt="" />
</Frame>

### 2. Calculate the implied rates from Best Ask, Best Bid, Last Trade relative to the Spot Price

<Frame caption="Rates implied from SOL-USD-PERP best bid, best ask and last trade price relative to the spot price">
  <img src="file:51e6b430-719b-4e7a-b7b6-a6814b8c4175" alt="" />
</Frame>

### 3. Calculate the EWMA \*\*(Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) of each of the three rates (\*\*Paradex EWMA rates) **and take the median**

In this example, an EWMA weight of 20% is applied to the latest rate observation

<Frame caption="EWMA of SOL-USD-PERP rates implied from best bid, best ask and last trade price relative to the spot price">
  <img src="file:dde420d2-5afb-4710-b308-a7176a8fe6b7" alt="" />
</Frame>

### 5. Calculate the EWMA **(Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) of the Mid Rate**

The **Mid Rate EWMA** is calculated from the implied rate of the Mid Price relative to the Spot Price, where Mid Price is calculated as:

$$
\text{Mid Price}=\frac{\big(\text{Best Ask} + \text{Best Bid}\big)}{2}
$$

### 6. Calculate the median of the External Rates

The **External Rates** are determined from Mark Prices and Index Prices fetched from external exchanges (actually, Bybit, Binance and OKX) and calculated as:

$$
\text{External Rate}=\big(\frac{\text{Mark Price}}{\text{Index Price}} -1\big) * \frac{\text{Paradex Funding Interval}}{\text{Exchange Funding Interval}}
$$

Where Paradex Funding Interval is actually 8h for all instruments

### 7. Calculate the Fair Basis

Finally, the **Fair Basis** is calculated as the median of the three components

$$
\text{Fair Basis}=\text{median}\big(\text{Paradex EWMA rates}, \text{Mid Rate EWMA, median(External Rates)})
$$

### 8. Calculate the Mark Price by applying the Fair Basis to the Spot Price

<Frame caption="SOL-USD-PERP mark price compared to the underlying spot price">
  <img src="file:ee6f26c6-204b-4d30-985c-726fd4373240" alt="" />
</Frame>

Note that the **Fair Basis** is different from the **Funding Rate**, the Funding Rate is derived from the Fair Basis using the formula [described here](funding-mechanism#funding-rate)

Here a comparison between the Fair Basis and the Funding Rate in this example :

# Cross Margin Requirement

In Cross Margin, the account margin requirement is the total sum of margin requirements across markets :

$$
\text{Account Margin Requirement}~=~\sum\limits_{\text{market}~m}\text{Margin Requirement}(m)
$$

where $\text{Margin Requirement}$ can refer to **Initial Margin Requirement (IMR)** or **Maintenance Margin Requirement (MMR)**

# Initial Margin Requirement (IMR)

## Open Size

Open size represents the maximum position size the account can have if all orders on one side or the other are filled :

* $\text{Buy open size} = \max(0,~\text{Total size of buy orders} + \text{Signed position size})$
* $\text{Sell open size} = \max(0,~\text{Total size of sell orders} - \text{Signed position size})$

where the position sign is positive for a long position and negative for a short position

## IMR Breakdown

$\text{IMR}(m)$ is the account IMR for market $m$ and is composed of :

* $\text{Net IMR}$: This is a fraction of the Open Size value in USD. The fraction is called IMF (Initial Margin Fraction) and is equal to 1 / Leverage. The leverage is set by default to the market maximum leverage but can be updated to a lower level by the user.
* $\text{Fee Provision}$: This is a provision for the amount of entry/exit fees that the account is expected to pay based on open position/orders.
* $\text{Open Loss}$: This is a provision for orders that are aggressive relative to the mark price and are expected to lead to immediate unrealized loss after they are filled

$$
\text{IMR}(m)=\text{Net IMR}(m)+\text{Fee Provision}(m)+\text{Open Loss}(m)
$$

## Net IMR

For perpetual futures, the IMR for each side (buy/sell) is calculated as :

* $\text{Buy Initial Margin Requirement (IMR)} = \text{Buy open size * IMF}*\text{Mark Price}$
* $\text{Sell Initial Margin Requirement (IMR)} = \text{Sell open size * IMF}*\text{Mark Price}$

The Market Net IMR is equal to:

$$
\text{Market Net IMR}=\max(\text{Buy IMR},~\text{Sell IMR})
$$

### Example

User has :

* Short 1 BTC-USD-PERP (the signed position size is -1 BTC)
* 3 Buy BTC-USD-PERP open orders
* 2 Sell BTC-USD-PERP open orders

Assuming :

* BTC-USD-PERP IMF = 2%
* BTC-USD-PERP Mark Price is 90,000 USD

Buy open size = 3 - 1 = 2 BTC

Sell open size = 2 + 1 = 3 BTC

This user’s IMR for BTC-USD-PERP is :

Net IMR = Sell IMR = 2% \* 3 \* 90,000 = 5,400 USD

# Maintenance Margin Requirement (MMR)

The Maintenance Margin Requirement (MMR) only depends on open positions (not impacted by open orders) and is composed of :

* $\text{Net MMR}$: This is a fraction of the $\text{Net IMR}$ based on $\text{MMF Factor}$
  <Note>$\text{MMF Factor}$ is currently set to $50\%$ for all perpetual futures. This means that Net MMR is half of the Net IMR</Note>
* $\text{Fee Provision}$: This is a provision for the position exit fee, so this is equal to $\text{Taker Fee * Position Value}$

# Leverage

<Frame>
  <img src="file:8da2da0d-dd4e-4cfd-9565-05bc4a2ce83d" />
</Frame>

Account Leverage in UI shows two numbers :

* **Account Effective Leverage**

$$
\text{Account Effective Leverage}=\frac{\text{Open Notional}}{\text{Account Value}}
$$

where $\text{Open Notional}$ is the total Open Size expressed in USD and summed across markets

i.e.  $\text{Open Notional}=\sum\limits_{\text{market}~m}\text{Open Size}(m)*\text{Mark Price}(m)$

* **Account Maximum Leverage**

$$
\text{Account Maximum Leverage}=\frac{\text{Open Notional}}{\text{Account 
IMR}}
$$

This maximum leverage depends on the account maximum leverage per market. It represents the maximum allowed Effective Leverage beyond which the account will be unable to submit new orders that increase open notional.


# Price Bands

Price bands restricts the execution of aggressive orders to some bandwidth that contains the Mark Price. Any instrument will have dynamic **Limit down price** and **Limit up price**.

The price band for a perpetual future market is centered around the Mark Price according to a **% bandwidth parameter**.

> **Example :**
>
> * Bandwidth parameter = 5%
> * Mark price = \$100
>
> → **Limit down price** = \$95 and **Limit up price** = \$105
>
> * A limit sell order at \$94 is rejected
> * A “passive” limit buy order at \$90 is **NOT** rejected
> * A market buy order is assigned a limit price = \$105. Any quantity that is not immediately filled is rejected


# Position Limit

A submitted order is rejected if it can potentially increase the client's position beyond the position limit of the instrument.

The order is only accepted if the following condition holds :

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Position Limit} \geq \\
&\small\text{Submitted Order Size}+\text{Size of Same-Side Open Orders}+\text{Open Position Side}*\text{Open Position Size}
\end{align*}
$$

**Example :**

* **ETH-USD-PERP Position Limit = 1000 ETH**
* A user has an open **SHORT** position of size **900 ETH** and no open orders initially

-> Any **SELL order** with size higher than **100 ETH** (**= 1000 - 900**) will be rejected

-> Any **BUY order** with size higher than **1900 ETH (= 1000 + 900)** will be rejected


# Funding Mechanism

> An overview of how Paradex's unique continuous funding mechanism works

## Mechanism

The funding mechanism calculates the funding PnL for each open perpetual position. This PnL is realised when the position size changes after a trade.

The accrued funding contributes to the total unrealized PnL (hence to the account value). The accrued funding PnL is calculated in USDC (settlement asset).\
\
In order to reduce on-chain transaction spikes, Paradex has a continuous accrual mechanism. Funding is continuously accrued on an account with a perpetual futures position and the entire unrealized funding PnL of that account's position is settles every time the position is adjusted on-chain.

### Funding Premium

At a given time **t**, the **Funding Premium** represents the 8h amount paid by long positions to short positions. This value expressed in the settlement asset of the instrument (**USDC**) and depends on the Funding Rate using the relationship :

$$
\small \text{Funding~Premium}=\text{Funding~Rate}*\frac{\text{Spot Oracle Price}}{\text{USDC Oracle Price}}
$$

### Funding Rate

The **Funding Rate** is derived from [**Fair Basis**](mark-price-calculation#steps-to-calculate-the-fair-basis-and-the-mark-price) by applying interest rate clamping and by constraining the resulting value to the interval \[ − 𝑀 , + 𝑀 ] where M is the Maximum Funding Rate.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Funding Rate}=\text{capped}\Bigl(\text{Fair Basis} + \text{clamp}\bigl(\text{Interest Rate}, \text{Fair Basis}, \text{Clamp Rate}\big)\Bigr) \\
& ~\\
& \large\text{and} \\
& ~\\
& \text{clamp}\bigl(\text{Interest Rate}, \text{Fair Basis}, \text{Clamp Rate}\bigr) = \\
& \min\Bigl(\max\bigl(\text{Interest Rate}-\text{Fair Basis},~-~\text{Clamp Rate}\bigr),~+~\text{Clamp Rate}\Bigr)
& ~\\
& ~\\
& \text{capped}(x) = \text{max}(−~\text{Maximum Funding Rate}, \text{min}(x, \text{Maximum Funding Rate}))
& ~\\
& ~\\
\end{aligned}
$$

**Current values for the above settings are:**

* Interest Rate = 0.01%
* Clamp Rate = 0.05%
* Maximum Funding Rate = 5%

<img src="file:7ec52f85-04dd-4322-9737-fdd542df3526" alt="" />

### Funding Index

At a global level, a **Funding Index** calculates accrued funding for 1 unit of the asset since launch and is calculated as a time-weighted sum of the Funding Premium :

$$
\text{Funding Index (current timestamp)}=\int_{\text{launch timestamp}}^{\text{current timestamp}}\text{Funding Premium(t) dt}
$$

The **Funding Premium** is updated along with the mark price (every 5 seconds). This triggers an update of the funding index. The Funding Premium corresponds to the USDC amount paid by 1 unit of the contract continuously after **8h** if the prices remain unchanged.

At any point in time, the **Current Funding Index** can be calculated as :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& {\textbf{Current Funding Index}}~=\\
& \small\text{Last Cached Funding Index}~+~\small\text{Funding Premium}*\frac{\text{current timestamp}-\text{cached timestamp}}{8*3600}
\end{aligned}
$$

where timestamps are expressed in seconds.

### Accrued Funding

The **Accrued (Unrealized) Funding** of an open perpetual position depends on the change in the funding index since its last cached value (from last trade) :

$$
\begin{align*}
& {\textbf{Accrued Funding PnL}}~=\\
& ~-~\small\text{Perpetual Position Size}~*~(\small\text{Current Funding Index - Cached Funding Index})*\small\text{USDC Oracle Price}
\end{align*}
$$

where **Perpetual Position Size** is a signed position size (positive in case of a long position, negative in case of short position)

Whenever the account updates an existing perpetual position, accrued funding is realised :

$$
\begin{align*}
& {\textbf{Funding Realized PnL}}~=\\
& -~\text{Previous Perpetual Position Size}~*~(\text{Current Funding Index - Cached Funding Index})
\end{align*}
$$

## **Example**

* Initial market data at time $t_0$ :

$\text{Funding Index}_\text{ XYZ-USD-PERP}(t_0)=1'000~\text{USDC}$

$\text{Mark Price}_\text{ XYZ-USD-PERP}(t_0)=112$

$\text{XYZ Oracle Price}(t_0)=100$

$\text{USDC Oracle Price}=1$

Therefore : $\text{Funding Premium}_\text{ XYZ-USD-PERP}(t_0)=\frac{\text{Mark~Price}~-~\text{Spot~Oracle~Price}}{\text{USDC Oracle Price}}=12~\text{USDC}$

* Alice enters a long position of size 50 XYZ-USD-PERP at $t_0$
* For example simplicity, we assume prices stay unchanged for 1 hour, i.e. the Funding Premium remains the same :

$$
\begin{align*}
& {\small\textbf{Funding Index}_\text{ XYZ-USD-PERP}(t_0+1~\small\text{hour})} \\
& =\small\text{Funding Index}_\text{ XYZ-USD-PERP}(t_0 )~+~\frac{\small\text{Funding Premium}_\text{XYZ-USD-PERP}(t_0)}{8}\\ 
& =1000+\frac{12}{8} \\
& =1001.5~\text{USDC}
& ~\\
\end{align*}
$$

Within the past hour, Alice accrued a **Funding Loss** equal to:

$$
\begin{align*}
50*(1'001.5-1'000.0)=75~\text{USDC}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that this negative PnL affects Alice's account value but is not reflected in the USDC balance until Alice's next $\text{XYZ-USD-PERP}$ trade.

* Exactly at $t_0+1~\text{hour}$, XYZ-USD-PERP Mark Price jumps to $118$. However, XYZ Spot Oracle Price remains unchanged. The funding premium now increases to $18~\text{USDC}$
* Assuming prices do not change during the next 2 hours (i.e. until $t_0+3~\text{hours}$), the funding index becomes : $\text{Funding Index}_\text{XYZ-USD-PERP}(t_0+3~\text{hours})=1'001.5+\frac{2*18}{8}=1'006~\text{USDC}$

  Alice's funding loss increases to $50*(1'006-1'000.0)=300~\text{USDC}$
* Alice decides to increase the long position size by successfully submitting a market order. This results in the previous accrued funding loss of 300 USDC to be realized (i.e. USDC balance is debited by 300) and accrued funding to be reset to zero.


# Deleveraging

## Mechanism

The deleveraging process is a periodic check for accounts with open orders to determine if the account has sufficient value to maintain those orders.

If the account does not meet the initial margin requirement, the exchange cancels open orders that increase the account's risk.

This prevents those orders from being matched resulting in a fill that is likely to be rejected on-chain since the order violates [Order Risk Check](paradex-risk-checks/).

The main objective of deleveraging is to prevent orders from resulting in invalid fills

This check compares the [Account Value](margin-term-reference#account-value-usd) to the [Initial Margin Requirement](margin-term-reference#margin-requirement) (check [here](cross-margin-requirement#initial-margin-requirement-imr) how IMR is calculated in Cross Margin Mode).

* If $\text{Account Value} < \text{Account IMR}$, **Account Deleveraging** kicks in :
  * All orders that do not offset an open position on the same instrument (i.e. the account does not have an open position in this instrument **or** has an open position on the same side as the open order) are cancelled since these non-offsetting
  * Order offsetting an open position (opposite side) are not cancelled unless the cumulative size of those orders exceeds the position size, in which case the most passive orders are cancelled until the remaining cumulative size of offsetting orders is equal or lower than the position size

## Example

Alice account has :

* A **long** ETH-USD-PERP position of size **10**
* A **buy** ETH-USD-PERP order of size **2** with a limit price of **1'900**
* A **sell** ETH-USD-PERP order of size **5** with a limit price of **2'150**
* A **sell** ETH-USD-PERP order of size **3** with a limit price of **2'100**
* A **sell** ETH-USD-PERP order of size **3** with a limit price of **2'200**

Due to ETH-USD-PERP price decrease, Alice account value drops below the account IMR and the exchange puts the account in **Deleveraging Mode** :

* First, the buy order is cancelled since it is on the same side as the position
* The total size of sell orders is **11** which is higher than the position size (10) :
  * The exchange starts by cancelling the most passive order (sell order of size 3 at price 2'200)
  * The total remaining sell order is **8** which is less than the position size. Therefore, no more order cancellation is made

After deleveraging, Alice end up with :

* A **long** ETH-USD-PERP position of size **10**
* A **sell** ETH-USD-PERP order of size **5** with a limit price of **2'150**
* A **sell** ETH-USD-PERP order of size **3** with a limit price of **2'100**


# Liquidations

> A summary of Paradex liquidation mechanism

## Liquidation Process

When an account's Margin Ratio goes above 100% during the periodic [Health Check](paradex-risk-checks#health-check), the account will enter Liquidation.

Paradex employs **Partial Liquidation** of unhealthy accounts and attempts to minimise impact on the user's assets and positions while minimising the platform risk.

All positions are reduced by the same fraction called **Liquidation Share**. A corresponding **Liquidation Penalty** is paid from the user's collateral to the insurance fund.

$$
\text{Liquidation Penalty}=\text{Liquidation Share}~*~\text{Liquidation Fee}~*~\text{MMR}
$$

The minimum **Liquidation Share** is pre-calculated such that the Margin Ratio is reduced below **90%** This parameter aims to move the account sufficiently away from the liquidation level. The **Liquidation Share** is a multiple of **20%**.

The **Liquidation Fee** is set to **70%**. This means that the liquidation penalty is 70% of the MMR in case of a full liquidation of positions.

### **Example**

Alice has the following portfolio :

* **Long 0.1 BTC-USD-PERP** with an entry price of **60,000**
* **Short 1 ETH-USD-PERP** with an entry price of **3,000**
* **1,000 USDC** collateral

Assuming :

* **Maintenance Margin Fraction (MMF) = 1%** for both **BTC-USD-PERP and ETH-USD-PERP**
* BTC-USD-PERP mark price drops to 54,800 and the ETH-USD-PERP mark price goes up to 3,400

<table>
  <thead><tr><th width="168" /><th width="214">Unrealized PnL</th><th>MMR (Maintenance Margin Requirement)</th></tr></thead>

  <tbody><tr><td>BTC-USD-PERP</td><td>0.1 * (54,800 - 60,000) = <strong>-520 USD</strong></td><td>1% * 0.1 * 54,800 = <strong>54.8 USD</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ETH-USD-PERP</td><td>-1 * (3,400 - 3,000) = <strong>-400 USD</strong></td><td>1% * 1 * 3,400 = <strong>34 USD</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>-920 USD</strong></td><td><strong>88.8 USD</strong></td></tr></tbody>
</table>

Alice's Account Value = 1,000 - 920 = 80 USD \< MMR = 88.8 USD

The following table illustrates how the optimal liquidation share is calculated by predicting the new margin ratio depending on the liquidation share :

| Liquidation Share | New MMR | Liquidation Penalty | New Account Value | New Margin Ratio |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 20%               | 71.04   | 8.88                | 71.12             | 99.9%            |
| 40%               | 53.28   | 17.76               | 62.24             | 85.6%            |
| 60%               | 35.52   | 26.64               | 53.36             | 66.6%            |
| 80%               | 17.76   | 35.52               | 44.48             | 39.9%            |

In this example, the insurance fund will liquidate 40% of the user's positions to bring the account's Margin Ratio below 90% and will receive 17.76 USDC as a liquidation penalty

Alice realized a loss of 40% \* 920 = 368 USD and is left with 1,000 - 368 - 17.76 = 614.24 USDC collateral

Alice is also left with a long 0.06 BTC-USD-PERP and a short 0.6 ETH-USD-PERP positions

The margin ratio of Alice is now 85.6% and the insurance fund only took 17.76/88.8=20% of the account value to perform this liquidation and make the account healthy again.

Note that this process can result in a full liquidation in the event where the remaining collateral after a 100% liquidation of positions is not sufficient to pay the liquidation penalty.

The liquidated positions as well as the liquidation penalty are transferred over to the **Insurance Fund** upon liquidation.

## Insurance Fund

The Insurance Fund closes the acquired positions in the market, incurring any losses from adverse price movements against the position.

You can see the balance of Paradex's Insurance Fund **on cloud** [***here***](https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/insurance)***.***

The Insurance Fund serves as a backstop to minimise the risk of socialized losses. It prevents the propagation of risk from bankrupt accounts toward the rest of the market.

## Tutorial: Checking Insurance Fund Balance on Paraclear Contract

<Info>
  The insurance fund on the Paraclear contract holds funds to cover losses in case of liquidation. It doesn't show its balance on the Voyager app because the funds are not held in the USDC contract itself.

   Open the following link to access the Paraclear contract on the Voyager platform: [Paraclear Contract on Voyager](https://voyager.prod.paradex.trade/contract/0x03ca9388f8d4e04adecbd7b06b9b24a33030a593522248a7bddd87afc0b61a0c)
2. **Switch to the "Read Contract" Tab:**

   Once on the contract page, navigate to the "Read Contract" tab at the top of the interface. This tab allows you to access read-only contract functions that display on-chain data.
3. **Find the `getTokenAssetBalance` Function**:\
   Scroll down to find the function named `getTokenAssetBalance`. This function will return the balance of a specific token for a given address.
4. **Input the Required Addresses:**\
   In the first input field, enter the insurance fund address:

   `0x78d1acdc72fcacd35325402740fca2f7065fd680e59b950326a344710bcd687`

   In the second input field, enter the USDC token address:

   `0x7348407ebad690fec0cc8597e87dc16ef7b269a655ff72587dafff83d462be2`
5. **Query the Balance:**\
   After entering the addresses, click the "Query" button. This will execute the function and return the balance of the insurance fund in USDC tokens.
6. **Understand the Result:**\
   The returned value will be the balance of the insurance fund in USDC tokens. The precision of the returned value is 8 decimals, meaning the number you see has 8 decimal places.

   Note that USDC has a precision of 6 decimals. To get the actual balance, you'll need to adjust for this. For example, if the result is 1000000000, the balance would be 10 USDC

> **Example:**
>
> \- Insurance fund address: 0x78d1acdc72fcacd35325402740fca2f7065fd680e59b950326a344710bcd687
>
> \- USDC token address: 0x7348407ebad690fec0cc8597e87dc16ef7b269a655ff72587dafff83d462be2
>
> Once the query is performed, if the returned value is 1000000000, the actual USDC balance of the insurance fund is 10 USDC.

## Socialized Losses

When Paradex Insurance Fund is bankrupt due to large amounts of unprofitable liquidations, [Socialised Losses](socialized-losses) will occur as a last level of backstop.


# Socialized Losses

## Context

Socialized Losses happen when Paradex Insurance Fund is bankrupt due to large amounts of unprofitable liquidations. Paradex is built to minimize the probability of such an event but it can still happen. In this case the exchange would have insufficient USDC funds to meet withdrawal requests for all client funds.

During periods of insufficient capitalization Paradex applies Socialized Loss charge to all withdrawals. Socialized Loss Factor represents how much percentage each withdrawal will be charged at current point in time in order to offset the loss. Only users who withdraw during those "shortfall" periods are affected by Socialized Losses.

Once the Insurance Fund is re-capitalized (though profitable liquidations or fund transfer) Paradex stops applying Socialized Loss charge to withdrawals.

## Definitions

### Account Bankruptcy Amount

For a given trading account, USDC Settlement Balance represents the USDC balance that this account would have if all its open positions were closed at current Mark Price :

$$
\small\text{Account USDC Settlement Balance}=\text{Account USDC Balance}+\frac{\text{Account Unrealized PnL}}{\text{USDC Oracle Price}}
$$

Since Paradex currently only accepts USDC as collateral, this is equal to the [Account Value](margin-term-reference#account-value-usd) expressed in USDC, i.e. : $\frac{\text{Account Value}}{\text{USDC Oracle Price}}$

The Bankruptcy Amount of an account is equal to :

$$
\text{Bankruptcy Amount}=\max(0,~-\text{Account USDC Settlement Balance})
$$

i.e. Bankruptcy Amount is positive only if account will be bankrupt at current Mark prices. Otherwise it is zero.

### Exchange Bankruptcy Amount

The exchange Bankruptcy Amount is equal to :

$$
\begin{align*} 
&\text{Exchange Bankruptcy Amount}= \\
&\max(0,\small\text{Total Users Bankruptcy Amount}-\small\text{Insurance Fund USDC Balance})
\end{align*}
$$

### Socialized Loss Factor

$$
\small\text{Socialized Loss Factor}=\frac{\text{Exchange Bankruptcy Amount}}{\text{Total Exchange USDC Balance + \text{Exchange Bankruptcy Amount}}}
$$

If Exchange Bankruptcy Amount is positive (i.e. Insurance fund has negative value or shortfall from bankrupt user accounts is higher than Insurance Fund value), Socialized Loss Factor is greater than 0 and all withdrawals will be penalized by this factor.

Only withdrawals are subject to socialized loss penalty, users who do not withdraw are not affected

##

## **Example**

**Insurance Fund has initially 1'000 UDSC balance and no open positions.**

**There are three traders on the exchange : Alice, Bob and Charlie. Each of them has a 1'000 USDC balance. The oracle price of USDC is 1 USD.**

Therefore. the Total Exchange USDC Balance is $4'000$

**Alice buys 50 XYZ-USD-PERP against Bob at a 100 USD**

**The Mark Price of XYZ-USD-PERP suddenly crashes down to 40**

Alice now has an [Unrealized PnL](margin-term-reference#unrealized-pnl-usd) of : $50 * (40-100)=-3'000 ~\text{USD}$

and has a negative [Account Value](margin-term-reference#account-value-usd) (bankrupt account) of $1'000-3'000=-2'000~\text{USD}$

Therefore, Alice [Bankruptcy Amount](socialized-losses#account-bankruptcy-amount) is 2'000 USDC and the [Exchange Bankruptcy Amount](socialized-losses#exchange-bankruptcy-amount) is $2'000-1'000=1'000~\text{USDC}$

The [Socialized Loss Factor](socialized-losses#socialized-loss-factor) is then equal to $\frac{1'000}{4'000}=25\%$

Charlie withdraws 500 USDC : The Insurance Fund receives $25\%*500=125~\text{USDC}$ and Charlie's withdrawal address receives $75\%*500=375~\text{USDC}$

**The Insurance Fund takes over Alice account.** Note that Bankruptcy Amount is unchanged (1'000 USDC)

**The Mark Price of XYZ-USD-PERP quickly moves up to 70**

Now the Insurance Fund position (taken over from Alice) only has $50*(70-100)=-1'500~\text{USD}$ Unrealized PnL. This means that the Insurance Fund is not bankrupt anymore and has $2'000-1'500=+500~\text{USD}$

This brings the Exchange Bankruptcy Amount to 0 and the Socialized Loss Factor to 0%.

Therefore, withdrawals are now no longer subject to any loss.


# Trade Flow & Busts

Paradex is a hybrid trading system with off-chain (cloud) and on-chain components. The matching engine runs on the cloud. The users interact with it by submitting orders. The cloud assesses if the order causes the account to exceed risk limits (account value must not be below initial margin requirement) in which case cloud rejects the order. This check relies on the composition of the portfolio (collateral + positions + orders) as well as market data (e.g. external oracle price, funding data etc).

Once the order crosses against a matching order in the cloud order book, a fill is sent to the chain. The off-chain account balances are updated and the user can proceed with trading which gives a high-performance exchange experience.

The chain independently checks the new account composition and can reject the trade when the account would violate the initial margin requirement if the trade had happened. Although the cloud risk assessment is usually more conservative than on-chain, the independent on-chain risk check can result in a rejection of the trade.

If this happens, the account off-chain data data is rectified to revert the impact of the invalid trade.

A significant amount of our focus is currently directed towards minimizing the occurrence of trade busts in order to make this kind of risk significantly low.

# RPC Node

Our RPC Node Proxy operates as a secure gateway that provides authenticated access to the StarkNet RPC node. It acts as an intermediary between your applications and StarkNet nodes, requiring cryptographic signatures for all authenticated requests to ensure security and privacy.

## Overview

The RPC Node Proxy implements a signature-based authentication system using EIP-712 typed data for StarkNet. While non-authenticated requests are allowed, they return masked data for privacy.

When you authenticate with your account's private key, you gain full access to your own account's data, while other accounts' data remains masked. This privacy-preserving approach ensures that users can access their own information while protecting sensitive data from other accounts on the network.

<Note title="RPC Compatibility">
  * Apart from the authentication layer and data masking, the proxy is fully compatible with standard StarkNet RPC nodes. It follows the [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) and supports all [StarkNet RPC API methods](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/tree/master/api) with identical input parameters and output formats.
  * Supports both v0.7 and v0.8 StarkNet RPC endpoints
</Note>

## Access Model

## Security Considerations

* **Private Key Security**: Never expose your private keys in client-side code
* **Timestamp Validation**: Ensure your system clock is synchronized to prevent timestamp-related errors
  * Future timestamps: Maximum 1 second tolerance
  * Past timestamps: Subject to configurable expiry time
* **Signature Uniqueness**: Each request requires a fresh signature with a current timestamp
* **Network Security**: Always use HTTPS when making requests to the proxy

## Error Responses

# Starknet Wallets

## Starknet Wallets (Beta)

Starknet ecosystem users have been seeking ways to utilize Paradex. As Paradex operates as an appchain, there were no existing methods for communication between Starknet and Paradex. To address this, we have extended key generation to Starknet accounts, enabling your connected Starknet wallet to deterministically derive a Paradex Account. Additionally, we have collaborated with [Cross Chain Bridging](/documentation/accounts/deposits-and-withdrawals/cross-chain-bridging) partners to support deposit and withdrawal flows for these accounts.\
\
To get started, simply connect your Starknet wallet to the Paradex app, where a Paradex Account will be derived from a signature. Signature derivation require connected Starknet wallets that sign deterministically.

<Warning>
  Please note that if the owner of the deployed account changes it could affect the signature generated by the wallet. Therefore, we strongly recommend users back up their private keys to ensure the continuity of their Paradex accounts.

  If you encounter any issues or have questions, please contact our support team via our official communication channels.
</Warning>

# Server Location

Our servers are located in the AWS AP-NORTHEAST-1 region (Tokyo). The best way to synchronize your clock with our servers is via the Amazon time service.

## Global IP Address

Paradex leverages AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic to our infrastructure in Tokyo. It provides us with static IP addresses that are geographically distributed across the AWS global network.

These IP addresses may appear to be located in the US by some DNS lookup tools due to AWS being a US-based company. However, the actual path your traffic takes prioritizes the closest AWS edge location, ensuring efficient routing to our Tokyo infrastructure. This minimizes latency and delivers a smooth user experience regardless of your geographical location.

For a more in-depth explanation, check out the [AWS Global Accelerator docs](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/features/).

## Interacting with private endpoint

To interact with private Paradex endpoints you need to onboard and generate a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction) before making API requests. JWTs are a secure way to transmit information between parties. Please refer to the **Authentication** chapter and [onboarding and authentication code samples](https://github.com/tradeparadex/code-samples).


# Authentication

Your software will have to authenticate itself when:

1. You onboard your wallet using automatic onboarding code
2. You generate JWT (see below) for a private Rest API call or subscription to a private WebSocket
3. You send order to Paradex

## What is JWT

Paradex uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://jwt.io/introduction) to authenticate users.

JWTs are a secure way to transmit information between parties as they are signed by the sender, which allows the recipient to verify the authenticity of the message.

> **For security reasons JWTs used in Paradex's authentication mechanism expire every 5 minutes.** **It is not possible to extend the expiration.**

This means that users will need to **re-authenticate** regularly in order to always have a fresh JWT readily available.

Paradex recommends refreshing JWT well before expiry (e.g., after 3 minutes) to allow multiple retry attempts while still having a valid JWT.

This will help you to avoid interruptions in making REST API calls.

When using **WebSocket** connections, after the initial authentication, users do not need to re-authenticate again for the lifetime of the connection.

[See more regarding Paradex JWT mechanism](https://docs.api.prod.paradex.trade/#get-jwt).

## Benefits of using JWT

The benefits of using JWT for authentication:

* **Security**: JWTs are signed by the issuer, which allows the recipient to verify the authenticity of the message.
* **Efficiency**: JWTs are small and lightweight, which makes them efficient to transmit over the network.

### Public Endpoints

| Endpoint           | Rate Limit | Per        |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Default            | 1500 req/m | IP address |
| `POST /onboarding` | 600 req/m  | IP address |
| `POST /auth`       | 600 req/m  | IP address |

### Private Endpoints

| Endpoint                    | Rate Limit               | Per     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| `POST, DELETE, PUT /orders` | 800 req/s OR 17250 req/m | Account |
| `GET /*`                    | 120 req/s OR 600 req/m   | Account |

<Note>
  Private endpoint rate limits are applied per account, but are also subject to an
  **additional IP-based rate limit of 1500 req/m** across all accounts from the same IP address.
</Note>


# Open Orders per Account

The rate limit for open orders per account is set to a maximum of *<span>100 orders per market</span>*.


# Common Questions

**What algorithm do you use for rate limits?**

* Leaky Bucket Algorithm rate limiting
* This technique uses a "token bucket" system based on a maximum number of available request tokens for a given timeframe. Each request consumes one token, and tokens are continuously refilled at a fixed rate. When all tokens are consumed, further requests are blocked until new tokens become available.
* Distributed across instances: the system coordinates token usage across all our servers to maintain the global limit.

**What if I hit a rate limit, how long is the cool down period?**

Since token refilling is a continuous process, there's no fixed cooldown period. As soon as a single token is refilled, you can make another request. The wait time depends on how many tokens you've used and the refill rate - it could be just milliseconds if you're slightly over the limit, or longer if you've exhausted your entire token bucket.

<Tip title="Rate limit example">
  If you have a 600 requests/minute limit:

  * Tokens will refill at \~10 tokens per second (1 token every 100ms)
  * If you have 0 tokens available you will wait \~100ms for 1 new token to be refilled
  * For continuous requests: You can make 1 request every 100ms sustainably
  * If you want to make multiple requests quickly you will need to wait longer to accumulate more tokens (e.g., 500ms to get 5 tokens)
</Tip>

**How long will an API query run before timing out?**

* All public and private API endpoints have a default timeout set to 30 seconds
* In the case of a timeout, the API will return a 503 error


# Benchmarks

## Order signing benchmarks

Orders that you send to Paradex must be signed. The signature is verified both by Paradex API and during on-chain settlement to ensure that the order was created by you and was not modified.

This section provides an overview of the speed of order signature in currently implemented programming languages.

### Code

* [Benchmarking code for Go, Java, Python, TypeScript](https://github.com/tradeparadex/code-samples)
* [Rust implementation](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starknet-rs/blob/master/starknet-crypto/benches/ecdsa_sign.rs)
* [C++ implementation](https://github.com/tradeparadex/starknet-signing-cpp)

# List tradebusts

GET https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/tradebusts

Returns paginated tradebusts for the account.

A tradebust occurs when a fill fails to clear and settle on the Paradex Chain.
The results of busted fills are not reflected on-chain and are reverted in the
cloud (off-chain position cache).

#### StarkNet Message Hash and Signature

Inspired by [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712),
(a standard for hashing and signing typed structured data)
the encoding of an off-chain message is defined as:

`signed_data = Enc[PREFIX_MESSAGE, domain_separator, account, hash_struct(message)]`

where:

- `PREFIX_MESSAGE = "StarkNet Message"`
- `domain_separator` is defined as the `hash_struct` of the StarkNetDomain struct:
  * Struct contains: `name`, `chainId` and `version`
  * `chainId` is can be obtained calling `GET /system/config`
- `account` is the StarkNet account address
- The message to be hashed is represented as a struct
  * `hash_struct(message) = Enc[type_hash(MyStruct), Enc[param1], ..., Enc[paramN]]`

  * More details on StarkNet - [Hash Functions](https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/cryptography/#hash_functions)

In case of more complex structure of object, you have to work in the spirit of EIP-712.
This json structure has 4 mandatory items: `types`, `primaryType`, `domain` and `message`.
These items are designed to be able to be an interface with a wallet.
At sign request, the wallet will display:

- `message` will be displayed at the bottom of the wallet display,
showing clearly (not in hex) the message to sign.
Its structure has to be in accordance with the type listed in primaryType,
defined in types.
- `domain` will be shown above the message.
Its structure has to be in accordance with `StarkNetDomain`.

The predefined types that you can use :

- `felt` : for an integer on 251 bits.
- `felt*` : for an array of felt.
- `string` : for a shortString of 31 ASCII characters max.
- `selector` : for a name of a smart contract function.
- `merkletree` : for a Root of a Merkle tree, calculated with the provided data.

        #### StarkNet Message Hash and Signature


        Inspired by [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712),

        (a standard for hashing and signing typed structured data)

        the encoding of an off-chain message is defined as:


        `signed_data = Enc[PREFIX_MESSAGE, domain_separator, account,
        hash_struct(message)]`


        where:


        - `PREFIX_MESSAGE = "StarkNet Message"`

        - `domain_separator` is defined as the `hash_struct` of the
        StarkNetDomain struct:
          * Struct contains: `name`, `chainId` and `version`
          * `chainId` is can be obtained calling `GET /system/config`
        - `account` is the StarkNet account address

        - The message to be hashed is represented as a struct
          * `hash_struct(message) = Enc[type_hash(MyStruct), Enc[param1], ..., Enc[paramN]]`
          * where `type_hash` is defined as in EIP-712 (but using `selector` instead of `keccak`)

# Create block trade

POST https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/block-trades
Content-Type: application/json

Create a parent block trade for multi-party execution.

Block trades coordinate execution across multiple parties.
The initiator creates a parent block trade specifying trade details and
required signers, who must submit offers before execution.

**Requirements:**
- Required signers must have active onboarding and block trade functionality
- Valid StarkNet signature with expiration timestamp
- Each trade specifies market, size, price, and order details

**Workflow:**
1. Initiator creates parent block trade
2. Required signers submit offers
3. Initiator executes with selected offers
4. All trades processed together

# Create order

POST https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/orders
Content-Type: application/json

Submits a new order to Paradex.

Returns an order status object with a unique order `id` assigned by Paradex. This
order `id` serves as the primary identifier for the order.

The REST API performs basic validation and queues the order for risk checks
(order `status`=`NEW`).

Once validation and risk checks are successful, the order is sent to the matching
engine. The matching engine processes the order and updates the status to `OPEN`
if the order is resting. If the order is fully filled or cannot be processed, the
status changes to `CLOSED` and a `cancel_reason` code is provided (e.g., fully
filled or no liquidity).

# Cancel batch of orders by order IDs

DELETE https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/orders/batch
Content-Type: application/json

Queues cancellation for multiple orders by providing identifiers in a batch.

The request body can contain either or both of:
- `order_ids`: Array of order IDs assigned by Paradex
- `client_order_ids`: Array of client-assigned order IDs

```json
{
  "order_ids": ["order-id-1", "order-id-2"],
  "client_order_ids": ["client-id-1", "client-id-2"]
}
```

Returns a 200 OK status code with detailed results for each order:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "order-id-1",
      "client_id": "client-id-X",
      "account": "account-1",
      "market": "BTC-USD-PERP",
      "status": "QUEUED_FOR_CANCELLATION"
    },
    {
      "id": "order-id-2",
      "client_id": "client-id-Y",
      "account": "account-1",
      "market": "ETH-USD-PERP",
      "status": "ALREADY_CLOSED"
    },
    {
      "id": "order-id-3",
      "client_id": "client-id-1",
      "account": "account-1",
      "market": "BTC-USD-PERP",
      "status": "QUEUED_FOR_CANCELLATION"
    },
    {
      "client_id": "client-id-2",
      "status": "NOT_FOUND"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each result includes:
- `id`: Order ID (if the order was found)
- `client_id`: Client order ID (if available)
- `account`: Account that owns the order
- `market`: Market of the order
- `status`: One of:
  + `QUEUED_FOR_CANCELLATION`: Order was successfully queued for cancellation
  + `ALREADY_CLOSED`: Order was already in a closed state
  + `NOT_FOUND`: The order with the provided ID/client ID was not found

Confirmation of cancellation will be sent via websocket or can be verified from
GET /orders/:id endpoint.

Orders that are already in a CLOSED state will be included in the response with
status "ALREADY_CLOSED".

# Modify order

PUT https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/orders/{order_id}
Content-Type: application/json

Modify an existing open limit order or TPSL order by changing its
`price`, `size`, and/or `trigger_price`.

For untriggered TPSL orders, you can modify `trigger_price`,
`price` (limit orders only), and `size`.
Once a TPSL limit order triggers you can modify its `price` and `size`
just like a regular limit order,
but the `trigger_price` is no longer modifiable.

TPSL market orders execute immediately when triggered and
cannot be modified afterwards.

The modified order maintains its original order ID.

# Cancel order

DELETE https://api.prod.paradex.trade/v1/orders/{order_id}

Queues a cancellation for a specific order identified by its order ID (assigned by
Paradex).

Returns a 204 No Content status code with no response body which means the order
has been queued for cancellation.

Confirmation of cancellation will be sent via websocket or can be retried from
GET /orders/:id endpoint.

Orders that are already in a CLOSED state cannot be canceled.

# WebSocket API

The Paradex WebSocket API provides real-time market data and account updates. WebSockets allow for a persistent connection between the client and server, enabling efficient two-way communication.

## Server URLs

| Environment       | WebSocket URL                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Testnet (Sepolia) | wss\://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1 |
| Mainnet           | wss\://ws.api.prod.paradex.trade/v1    |

## Public vs Private Channels

The Paradex WebSocket API provides two types of channels:

* **Public Channels**: Publish information about the exchange that is not specific to a particular account. Examples include market summary, order book, trades, etc. You do not need to authenticate to subscribe to public channels.

* **Private Channels**: Publish information about a particular account. You need to authenticate to subscribe to private channels.

## Establishing a Connection

To establish a WebSocket connection, you can use various programming languages and libraries. When running Python-based code, Python 3.10+ is recommended.

### Example in Python

```python
import websocket
import json

websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Define a callback to check connection success
def on_open(ws):
    print('Connected')

# Connect to the WebSocket server
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(websocket_url, on_open=on_open)

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

Upon successful connection, you should see:

```
Connected
```

## Maintaining a Connection

Paradex has implemented ping/pong functionality as part of the WebSocket specification. This works at the protocol level:

* The server sends a ping message every 55 seconds
* The client must respond with a pong within 5 seconds
* Upon receiving the pong, the connection is renewed for 60 seconds
* If the server doesn't receive a pong within the 5-second window, the connection is terminated

Most modern WebSocket libraries and frameworks automatically handle ping/pong messages. If you're using older libraries or building a WebSocket client from scratch, you may need to implement this functionality manually.

To display incoming ping messages, you can use the following wscat command:

```bash
wscat -P -w 120 -c wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1 -x '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"subscribe","params":{"channel":"markets_summary"}}' | grep "ping"
```

## Next Steps

* Learn how to [authenticate your WebSocket connection](/ws/general-information/authentication)
* Explore [available channels and subscription methods](/ws/general-information/subscription-channels)
* Understand [error handling](/ws/general-information/error-handling) for WebSocket connections


# Server Location

Our servers are located in the AWS AP-NORTHEAST-1 region (Tokyo). The best way to synchronize your clock with our servers is via the Amazon time service.

## Global IP Address

Paradex leverages AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic to our infrastructure in Tokyo. It provides us with static IP addresses that are geographically distributed across the AWS global network.

These IP addresses may appear to be located in the US by some DNS lookup tools due to AWS being a US-based company. However, the actual path your traffic takes prioritizes the closest AWS edge location, ensuring efficient routing to our Tokyo infrastructure. This minimizes latency and delivers a smooth user experience regardless of your geographical location.

For a more in-depth explanation, check out the [AWS Global Accelerator docs](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/features/).


# Authentication

To access private channels in the Paradex WebSocket API, you must authenticate your connection. This page explains how to authenticate your WebSocket connection using a JWT token.

## Authentication Process

Authentication is required to subscribe to private channels. The JWT (bearer) token is obtained from the `POST /auth` endpoint of the REST API.

**Important**: After the initial authentication, you do not need to re-authenticate your WebSocket connection for the lifetime of the connection.

### Authentication Request

To authenticate your WebSocket connection, send an authentication message with the following format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "auth",
  "params": {
    "bearer": "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
  },
  "id": 0
}
```

### Authentication Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| bearer    | string | JWT token   | Yes      |

### Authentication Response

Upon successful authentication, you will receive a response similar to:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {},
  "usIn": 1682556415569005368,
  "usDiff": 1291796,
  "id": 0
}
```

## Example: Authenticating a WebSocket Connection

Here's a complete example of how to authenticate a WebSocket connection using Python:

```python
import websocket
import json

websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Define the message to send
message = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "auth",
  "params": {
    "bearer": "JWcgwMbK0bx1uFFef0Lri35ZDwypmCG0isuBv"
  },
  "id": 0
}

# Define a callback to check connection success
def on_open(ws):
    # Send the message
    ws.send(json.dumps(message))

# Define a callback to handle the response
def on_message(ws, message):
    response = json.loads(message)
    print(response)

# Connect to the WebSocket server
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(websocket_url, on_open=on_open, on_message=on_message)

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

## Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you will receive an error response. Common authentication errors include:

| Error Code | Description            |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 40110      | Malformed Bearer Token |
| 40111      | Invalid Bearer Token   |
| 40112      | Geo IP blocked         |

For more information on error handling, see the [Error Handling](/ws/general-information/error-handling) section.


# Subscription Channels

The Paradex WebSocket API allows you to subscribe to various channels to receive real-time updates. This page explains how to subscribe and unsubscribe from channels.

## Subscribing to Channels

To receive updates from a specific channel, you need to subscribe to it. Multiple calls to subscribe can be made, each for a different channel.

**Note**: Subscribing to the same channel more than once will return an error.

### Subscribe Request

To subscribe to a channel, send a message with the following format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "channel": "CHANNEL_NAME"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Subscribe Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description  | Required |
| --------- | ------ | ------------ | -------- |
| channel   | string | Channel name | Yes      |

### Subscribe Response

Upon successful subscription, you will receive a response similar to:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "channel": "CHANNEL_NAME"
  },
  "usIn": 1682556415569005368,
  "usDiff": 1291796,
  "id": 1
}
```

### Subscribe Response Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description  | Required |
| --------- | ------ | ------------ | -------- |
| channel   | string | Channel name | Yes      |

## Unsubscribing from Channels

To stop receiving updates from a specific channel, you need to unsubscribe from it.

**Note**: Unsubscribing from a channel that you are not subscribed to will return an error.

### Unsubscribe Request

To unsubscribe from a channel, send a message with the following format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "unsubscribe",
  "params": {
    "channel": "CHANNEL_NAME"
  },
  "id": 2
}
```

### Unsubscribe Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description  | Required |
| --------- | ------ | ------------ | -------- |
| channel   | string | Channel name | Yes      |

### Unsubscribe Response

Upon successful unsubscription, you will receive a response similar to:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "channel": "CHANNEL_NAME"
  },
  "usIn": 1682556415569005368,
  "usDiff": 1291796,
  "id": 2
}
```

### Unsubscribe Response Parameters

## Example: Subscribing to a Channel

Here's a complete example of how to subscribe to the `trades.ETH-USD-PERP` channel using Python:

```python
import websocket
import json

websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Define the message to send
auth = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "auth",
  "params": {
    "bearer": "JWcgwMbK0bx1uFFef0Lri35ZDwypmCG0isuBv"
  },
  "id": 0
}
message = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "channel": "trades.ETH-USD-PERP"
  },
  "id": 1
}

# Define a callback to check connection success
def on_open(ws):
    # Auth first
    ws.send(json.dumps(auth))
    # Send the message
    ws.send(json.dumps(message))

# Define a callback to handle the response
def on_message(ws, message):
    response = json.loads(message)
    print(response)

# Connect to the WebSocket server
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(websocket_url, on_open=on_open, on_message=on_message)

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

## Example: Unsubscribing from a Channel

Here's a complete example of how to unsubscribe from the `trades.ETH-USD-PERP` channel using Python:

```python
import websocket

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

Refer to the WebSocket Channels documentation for a list of supported channels.


# Error Handling

The Paradex WebSocket API uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for communication, which includes standardized error handling. This page explains the error format and common error codes.

## Error Message Format

When an error occurs, the WebSocket API returns an error message with the following format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": { 
    "code": -32601, 
    "message": "method does not exist" 
  },
  "usIn": 1710522972729581,
  "usOut": 1710522972729618,
  "usDiff": 37,
  "id": 4
}
```

### Error Object Properties

| Property | Type   | Description       | Required |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------- | -------- |
| code     | number | Error code        | Yes      |
| message  | string | Short explanation | Yes      |
| data     | string | Extra details     | No       |

## Error Codes

The Paradex WebSocket API uses standard JSON-RPC error codes as well as custom error codes.

### Standard JSON-RPC Error Codes

Error codes from -32768 to -32000 are pre-defined errors per the JSON-RPC specification:

| Code   | Description        |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| -32700 | Parse error        |
| -32600 | Invalid request    |
| -32601 | Method not found   |
| -32602 | Invalid parameters |
| -32603 | Internal error     |

### Paradex-Specific Error Codes

Other errors are specific to the Paradex WebSocket API:

| Code  | Description            |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 100   | Method error           |
| 40110 | Malformed Bearer Token |
| 40111 | Invalid Bearer Token   |
| 40112 | Geo IP blocked         |

## Common Error Scenarios

### Authentication Errors

Authentication errors occur when there are issues with the JWT token:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": { 
    "code": 40111, 
    "message": "Invalid Bearer Token" 
  },
  "usIn": 1710522972729581,
  "usOut": 1710522972729618,
  "usDiff": 37,
  "id": 0
}
```

### Subscription Errors

Subscription errors occur when there are issues with channel subscriptions:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": { 
    "code": -32602, 
    "message": "Invalid parameters" 
  },
  "usIn": 1710522972729581,
  "usOut": 1710522972729618,
  "usDiff": 37,
  "id": 1
}
```

### Method Errors

Method errors occur when an invalid method is called:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": { 
    "code": -32601, 
    "message": "method does not exist" 
  },
  "usIn": 1710522972729581,
  "usOut": 1710522972729618,
  "usDiff": 37,
  "id": 4
}
```

## Best Practices for Error Handling

1. **Check Error Codes**: Always check the error code to understand the type of error
2. **Log Errors**: Log all errors for debugging purposes
3. **Implement Retry Logic**: For transient errors, implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. **Handle Authentication Errors**: If you receive an authentication error, regenerate your JWT token and reconnect
5. **Validate Parameters**: Ensure all parameters are valid before sending requests


# Code Examples

This page provides complete code examples for common WebSocket operations using the Paradex API.

## Prerequisites

For Python examples, you'll need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install websocket-client
```

## Establishing a Connection

This example demonstrates how to establish a basic WebSocket connection:

```python
import websocket
import json

websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Define a callback to check connection success
def on_open(ws):
    print('Connected')

# Connect to the WebSocket server
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(websocket_url, on_open=on_open)

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

## Authenticating a Connection

This example demonstrates how to authenticate a WebSocket connection:

```python
import websocket
import json

websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Define the message to send
message = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "auth",
  "params": {
    "bearer": "JWcgwMbK0bx1uFFef0Lri35ZDwypmCG0isuBv"
  },
  "id": 0
}

# Define a callback to check connection success
def on_open(ws):
    # Send the message
    ws.send(json.dumps(message))

# Define a callback to handle the response
def on_message(ws, message):
    response = json.loads(message)
    print(response)

# Connect to the WebSocket server
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(websocket_url, on_open=on_open, on_message=on_message)

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

## Subscribing to a Channel

This example demonstrates how to subscribe to the `trades.ETH-USD-PERP` channel:

```python
import websocket
import json

websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Define the message to send
auth = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "auth",
  "params": {
    "bearer": "JWcgwMbK0bx1uFFef0Lri35ZDwypmCG0isuBv"
  },

  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "channel": "trades.ETH-USD-PERP"
  },
  "id": 1
}

# Define a callback to check connection success
def on_open(ws):

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

## Unsubscribing from a Channel

This example demonstrates how to unsubscribe from the `trades.ETH-USD-PERP` channel:

```python
import websocket
import json

websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Define the message to send
auth = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "auth",
  "params": {
    "bearer": "JWcgwMbK0bx1uFFef0Lri35ZDwypmCG0isuBv"
  },
  "id": 0
}
message = {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "unsubscribe",
  "params": {
    "channel": "trades.ETH-USD-PERP"
  },
  "id": 2
}

# Define a callback to check connection success
def on_open(ws):
    # Auth first
    ws.send(json.dumps(auth))
    # Send the message
    ws.send(json.dumps(message))

# Define a callback to handle the response
def on_message(ws, message):
    response = json.loads(message)
    print(response)

# Connect to the WebSocket server
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(websocket_url, on_open=on_open, on_message=on_message)

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

## Complete Example: Authentication, Subscription, and Message Handling

This example demonstrates a complete workflow including authentication, subscription, and message handling:

```python
import websocket
import json
import time

# WebSocket URL
websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Your JWT token
jwt_token = "JWcgwMbK0bx1uFFef0Lri35ZDwypmCG0isuBv"

# Message ID counter
message_id = 0

# Get next message ID
def get_next_id():
    global message_id
    message_id += 1
    return message_id

# Connection opened callback
def on_open(ws):
    print("Connection established")
    
    # Authenticate
    auth_message = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "auth",
        "params": {
            "bearer": jwt_token
        },
        "id": get_next_id()
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(auth_message))

# Message received callback
def on_message(ws, message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    print(f"Received: {data}")
    
    # Check if this is an authentication response
    if "result" in data and data.get("id") == 1:
        print("Authentication successful, subscribing to channel")
        
        # Subscribe to trades channel
        subscribe_message = {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "method": "subscribe",
            "params": {
                "channel": "trades.ETH-USD-PERP"
            },
            "id": get_next_id()
        }
        ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))

# Error callback
def on_error(ws, error):
    print(f"Error: {error}")

# Close callback
def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
    print(f"Connection closed: {close_status_code} - {close_msg}")

# Create WebSocket connection
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    websocket_url,
    on_open=on_open,
    on_message=on_message,
    on_error=on_error,
    on_close=on_close
)

# Start WebSocket connection
ws.run_forever()
```

## Implementation Notes

* **Error Handling**: The examples include basic error handling. In a production environment, implement more robust error handling and reconnection logic.
* **Authentication**: Replace the placeholder JWT token with your actual token.
* **Ping/Pong**: Most WebSocket libraries automatically handle ping/pong messages. If you're using a library that doesn't, you'll need to implement this functionality manually.
* **Reconnection**: Implement proper reconnection logic with exponential backoff for production use.


# Websocket Rate Limits

## Public Concurrent Connections

For public concurrent connections via our Websocket, the rate limit is set to a maximum of *<span>20 connections per second or 600 connections per minute</span>* per IP address.
