Prompts guide the behavior of large language models (LLM). [*Prompt engineering*](/langsmith/prompt-engineering-concepts) is the process of crafting, testing, and refining the instructions you give to an LLM so it produces reliable and useful responses.

LangSmith provides tools to create, version, test, and collaborate on prompts. You’ll also encounter common concepts like [*prompt templates*](/langsmith/prompt-engineering-concepts#prompts-vs-prompt-templates), which let you reuse structured prompts, and [*variables*](/langsmith/prompt-engineering-concepts#f-string-vs-mustache), which allow you to dynamically insert values (such as a user’s question) into a prompt.

In this quickstart, you’ll create, test, and improve prompts using either the UI or the SDK. This quickstart will use OpenAI as the example LLM provider, but the same workflow applies across other providers.

<Tip>
  If you prefer to watch a video on getting started with prompt engineering, refer to the quickstart [Video guide](#video-guide).
</Tip>

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **A LangSmith account**: Sign up or log in at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com).
* **A LangSmith API key**: Follow the [Create an API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key#create-an-api-key) guide.
* **An OpenAI API key**: Generate this from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Select the tab for UI or SDK workflows:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UI" icon="window">
    ## 1. Set workspace secret

In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), ensure that your OpenAI API key is set as a [workspace secret](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspace-secrets).

1. Navigate to <Icon icon="gear" /> **Settings** and then move to the **Secrets** tab.
    2. Select **Add secret** and enter the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and your API key as the **Value**.
    3. Select **Save secret**.

<Note> When adding workspace secrets in the LangSmith UI, make sure the secret keys match the environment variable names expected by your model provider.</Note>

## 2. Create a prompt

1. In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), navigate to the **Prompts** section in the left-hand menu.
    2. Click on **+ Prompt** to create a prompt.
    3. Modify the prompt by editing or adding prompts and input variables as needed.

To learn about more options for configuring your prompt in the Playground, refer to [Configure prompt settings](/langsmith/managing-model-configurations).

4. After testing and refining your prompt, click **Save** to store it for future use.

## 4. Iterate on a prompt

LangSmith allows for team-based prompt iteration. [Workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces) members can experiment with prompts in the playground and save their changes as a new [*commit*](/langsmith/prompt-engineering-concepts#commits) when ready.

To improve your prompts:

* Reference the documentation provided by your model provider for best practices in prompt creation, such as:
      * [Best practices for prompt engineering with the OpenAI API](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api)
      * [Gemini's Introduction to prompt design](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro)
    * Build and refine your prompts with the Prompt Canvas—an interactive tool in LangSmith. Learn more in the [Prompt Canvas guide](/langsmith/write-prompt-with-ai).
    * Tag specific commits to mark important moments in your commit history.

1. To create a commit, navigate to the **Playground** and select **Commit**. Choose the prompt to commit changes to and then **Commit**.
      2. Navigate to **Prompts** in the left-hand menu. Select the prompt. Once on the prompt's detail page, move to the **Commits** tab. Find the tag icon <Icon icon="tag" iconType="solid" /> to **Add a Commit Tag**.

## 2. Create a prompt

To create a prompt, you'll define a list of messages that you want in your prompt and then push to LangSmith.

Use the language-specific constructor and push method:

* Python: [`ChatPromptTemplate`](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.chat.ChatPromptTemplate.html) → [`client.push_prompt(...)`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/client/langsmith.client.Client#langsmith.client.Client.push_prompt)
    * TypeScript: [`ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages(...)`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.prompts.ChatPromptTemplate.html#fromMessages) → [`client.pushPrompt(...)`](https://langsmith-docs-7jgx2bq8f-langchain.vercel.app/reference/js/classes/client.Client#pushprompt)

1. Add the following code to a `create_prompt` file:

This creates an ordered list of messages, wraps them in `ChatPromptTemplate`, and then pushes the prompt by name to your [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces) for versioning and reuse.

2. Run `create_prompt`:

Follow the resulting link to view the newly created Prompt Hub prompt in the LangSmith UI.

In this step, you'll pull the prompt you created in [step 2](#2-create-a-prompt) by name (`"prompt-quickstart"`), format it with a test input, convert it to OpenAI’s chat format, and call the OpenAI Chat Completions API.

Then, you'll iterate on the prompt by creating a new version. Members of your workspace can open an existing prompt, experiment with changes in the [UI](https://smith.langchain.com), and save those changes as a new commit on the same prompt, which preserves history for the whole team.

1. Add the following to a `test_prompt` file:

This loads the prompt by name using `pull` for the latest committed version of the prompt that you're testing. You can also specify a specific commit by passing the commit hash `"<prompt-name>:<commit-hash>"`

2. Run `test_prompt` :

3. To create a new version of a prompt, call the same push method you used initially with the same prompt name and your updated template. LangSmith will record it as a new commit and preserve prior versions.

Copy the following code to an `iterate_prompt` file:

4. Run `iterate_prompt` :

Now your prompt will contain two commits.

To improve your prompts:

* Reference the documentation provided by your model provider for best practices in prompt creation, such as:
      * [Best practices for prompt engineering with the OpenAI API](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api)

[Memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory) is a system that remembers information about previous interactions. For AI agents, memory is crucial because it lets them remember previous interactions, learn from feedback, and adapt to user preferences. As agents tackle more complex tasks with numerous user interactions, this capability becomes essential for both efficiency and user satisfaction.

This conceptual guide covers two types of memory, based on their recall scope:

* [Short-term memory](#short-term-memory), or [thread](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#threads)-scoped memory, tracks the ongoing conversation by maintaining message history within a session. LangGraph manages short-term memory as a part of your agent's [state](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state). State is persisted to a database using a [checkpointer](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpoints) so the thread can be resumed at any time. Short-term memory updates when the graph is invoked or a step is completed, and the State is read at the start of each step.
* [Long-term memory](#long-term-memory) stores user-specific or application-level data across sessions and is shared *across* conversational threads. It can be recalled *at any time* and *in any thread*. Memories are scoped to any custom namespace, not just within a single thread ID. LangGraph provides [stores](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#memory-store) ([reference doc](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.base.BaseStore)) to let you save and recall long-term memories.

[Short-term memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory#add-short-term-memory) lets your application remember previous interactions within a single [thread](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#threads) or conversation. A [thread](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#threads) organizes multiple interactions in a session, similar to the way email groups messages in a single conversation.

LangGraph manages short-term memory as part of the agent's state, persisted via thread-scoped checkpoints. This state can normally include the conversation history along with other stateful data, such as uploaded files, retrieved documents, or generated artifacts. By storing these in the graph's state, the bot can access the full context for a given conversation while maintaining separation between different threads.

### Manage short-term memory

Conversation history is the most common form of short-term memory, and long conversations pose a challenge to today's LLMs. A full history may not fit inside an LLM's context window, resulting in an irrecoverable error. Even if your LLM supports the full context length, most LLMs still perform poorly over long contexts. They get "distracted" by stale or off-topic content, all while suffering from slower response times and higher costs.

Chat models accept context using messages, which include developer provided instructions (a system message) and user inputs (human messages). In chat applications, messages alternate between human inputs and model responses, resulting in a list of messages that grows longer over time. Because context windows are limited and token-rich message lists can be costly, many applications can benefit from using techniques to manually remove or forget stale information.

For more information on common techniques for managing messages, see the [Add and manage memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory#manage-short-term-memory) guide.

[Long-term memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory#add-long-term-memory) in LangGraph allows systems to retain information across different conversations or sessions. Unlike short-term memory, which is **thread-scoped**, long-term memory is saved within custom "namespaces."

Long-term memory is a complex challenge without a one-size-fits-all solution. However, the following questions provide a framework to help you navigate the different techniques:

* What is the type of memory? Humans use memories to remember facts ([semantic memory](#semantic-memory)), experiences ([episodic memory](#episodic-memory)), and rules ([procedural memory](#procedural-memory)). AI agents can use memory in the same ways. For example, AI agents can use memory to remember specific facts about a user to accomplish a task.
* [When do you want to update memories?](#writing-memories) Memory can be updated as part of an agent's application logic (e.g., "on the hot path"). In this case, the agent typically decides to remember facts before responding to a user. Alternatively, memory can be updated as a background task (logic that runs in the background / asynchronously and generates memories). We explain the tradeoffs between these approaches in the [section below](#writing-memories).

Different applications require various types of memory. Although the analogy isn't perfect, examining [human memory types](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory/types-of-memory?ref=blog.langchain.dev) can be insightful. Some research (e.g., the [CoALA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02427)) have even mapped these human memory types to those used in AI agents.

| Memory Type                      | What is Stored | Human Example              | Agent Example       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| [Semantic](#semantic-memory)     | Facts          | Things I learned in school | Facts about a user  |
| [Episodic](#episodic-memory)     | Experiences    | Things I did               | Past agent actions  |
| [Procedural](#procedural-memory) | Instructions   | Instincts or motor skills  | Agent system prompt |

[Semantic memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_memory), both in humans and AI agents, involves the retention of specific facts and concepts. In humans, it can include information learned in school and the understanding of concepts and their relationships. For AI agents, semantic memory is often used to personalize applications by remembering facts or concepts from past interactions.

<Note>
  Semantic memory is different from "semantic search," which is a technique for finding similar content using "meaning" (usually as embeddings). Semantic memory is a term from psychology, referring to storing facts and knowledge, while semantic search is a method for retrieving information based on meaning rather than exact matches.
</Note>

Semantic memories can be managed in different ways:

Memories can be a single, continuously updated "profile" of well-scoped and specific information about a user, organization, or other entity (including the agent itself). A profile is generally just a JSON document with various key-value pairs you've selected to represent your domain.

When remembering a profile, you will want to make sure that you are **updating** the profile each time. As a result, you will want to pass in the previous profile and [ask the model to generate a new profile](https://github.com/langchain-ai/memory-template) (or some [JSON patch](https://github.com/hinthornw/trustcall) to apply to the old profile). This can be become error-prone as the profile gets larger, and may benefit from splitting a profile into multiple documents or **strict** decoding when generating documents to ensure the memory schemas remains valid.

Alternatively, memories can be a collection of documents that are continuously updated and extended over time. Each individual memory can be more narrowly scoped and easier to generate, which means that you're less likely to **lose** information over time. It's easier for an LLM to generate *new* objects for new information than reconcile new information with an existing profile. As a result, a document collection tends to lead to [higher recall downstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall).

However, this shifts some complexity memory updating. The model must now *delete* or *update* existing items in the list, which can be tricky. In addition, some models may default to over-inserting and others may default to over-updating. See the [Trustcall](https://github.com/hinthornw/trustcall) package for one way to manage this and consider evaluation (e.g., with a tool like [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/tutorials/Developers/evaluation)) to help you tune the behavior.

Working with document collections also shifts complexity to memory **search** over the list. The `Store` currently supports both [semantic search](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.base.SearchOp.query) and [filtering by content](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.base.SearchOp.filter).

Finally, using a collection of memories can make it challenging to provide comprehensive context to the model. While individual memories may follow a specific schema, this structure might not capture the full context or relationships between memories. As a result, when using these memories to generate responses, the model may lack important contextual information that would be more readily available in a unified profile approach.

Regardless of memory management approach, the central point is that the agent will use the semantic memories to [ground its responses](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval), which often leads to more personalized and relevant interactions.

[Episodic memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory), in both humans and AI agents, involves recalling past events or actions. The [CoALA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02427) frames this well: facts can be written to semantic memory, whereas *experiences* can be written to episodic memory. For AI agents, episodic memory is often used to help an agent remember how to accomplish a task.

In practice, episodic memories are often implemented through few-shot example prompting, where agents learn from past sequences to perform tasks correctly. Sometimes it's easier to "show" than "tell" and LLMs learn well from examples. Few-shot learning lets you ["program"](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1627366413840322562) your LLM by updating the prompt with input-output examples to illustrate the intended behavior. While various best-practices can be used to generate few-shot examples, often the challenge lies in selecting the most relevant examples based on user input.

Note that the memory [store](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#memory-store) is just one way to store data as few-shot examples. If you want to have more developer involvement, or tie few-shots more closely to your evaluation harness, you can also use a [LangSmith Dataset](/langsmith/index-datasets-for-dynamic-few-shot-example-selection) to store your data. Then dynamic few-shot example selectors can be used out-of-the box to achieve this same goal. LangSmith will index the dataset for you and enable retrieval of few shot examples that are most relevant to the user input based upon keyword similarity ([using a BM25-like algorithm](/langsmith/index-datasets-for-dynamic-few-shot-example-selection) for keyword based similarity).

See this how-to [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37VaU7e7t5o) for example usage of dynamic few-shot example selection in LangSmith. Also, see this [blog post](https://blog.langchain.dev/few-shot-prompting-to-improve-tool-calling-performance/) showcasing few-shot prompting to improve tool calling performance and this [blog post](https://blog.langchain.dev/aligning-llm-as-a-judge-with-human-preferences/) using few-shot example to align an LLMs to human preferences.

### Procedural memory

[Procedural memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_memory), in both humans and AI agents, involves remembering the rules used to perform tasks. In humans, procedural memory is like the internalized knowledge of how to perform tasks, such as riding a bike via basic motor skills and balance. Episodic memory, on the other hand, involves recalling specific experiences, such as the first time you successfully rode a bike without training wheels or a memorable bike ride through a scenic route. For AI agents, procedural memory is a combination of model weights, agent code, and agent's prompt that collectively determine the agent's functionality.

In practice, it is fairly uncommon for agents to modify their model weights or rewrite their code. However, it is more common for agents to modify their own prompts.

One effective approach to refining an agent's instructions is through ["Reflection"](https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/) or meta-prompting. This involves prompting the agent with its current instructions (e.g., the system prompt) along with recent conversations or explicit user feedback. The agent then refines its own instructions based on this input. This method is particularly useful for tasks where instructions are challenging to specify upfront, as it allows the agent to learn and adapt from its interactions.

For example, we built a [Tweet generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn8A3BxfplE) using external feedback and prompt re-writing to produce high-quality paper summaries for Twitter. In this case, the specific summarization prompt was difficult to specify *a priori*, but it was fairly easy for a user to critique the generated Tweets and provide feedback on how to improve the summarization process.

The below pseudo-code shows how you might implement this with the LangGraph memory [store](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#memory-store), using the store to save a prompt, the `update_instructions` node to get the current prompt (as well as feedback from the conversation with the user captured in `state["messages"]`), update the prompt, and save the new prompt back to the store. Then, the `call_model` get the updated prompt from the store and uses it to generate a response.

## Tracing quickstart

**URL:** llms-txt#tracing-quickstart

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- 1. Create a directory and install dependencies
- 2. Set up environment variables
- 3. Define your application
- 4. Trace LLM calls
- 5. Trace an entire application
- Next steps
- Video guide

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/observability-quickstart

[*Observability*](/langsmith/observability-concepts) is a critical requirement for applications built with large language models (LLMs). LLMs are non-deterministic, which means that the same prompt can produce different responses. This behavior makes debugging and monitoring more challenging than with traditional software.

LangSmith addresses this by providing end-to-end visibility into how your application handles a request. Each request generates a [*trace*](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces), which captures the full record of what happened. Within a trace are individual [*runs*](/langsmith/observability-concepts#runs), the specific operations your application performed, such as an LLM call or a retrieval step. Tracing runs allows you to inspect, debug, and validate your application’s behavior.

In this quickstart, you will set up a minimal [*Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) application and add tracing with LangSmith. You will:

1. Configure your environment.
2. Create an application that retrieves context and calls an LLM.
3. Enable tracing to capture both the retrieval step and the LLM call.
4. View the resulting traces in the LangSmith UI.

<Tip>
  If you prefer to watch a video on getting started with tracing, refer to the quickstart [Video guide](#video-guide).
</Tip>

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **A LangSmith account**: Sign up or log in at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com).
* **A LangSmith API key**: Follow the [Create an API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key#create-an-api-key) guide.
* **An OpenAI API key**: Generate this from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

The example app in this quickstart will use OpenAI as the LLM provider. You can adapt the example for your app's LLM provider.

<Tip>
  If you're building an application with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) or [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), you can enable LangSmith tracing with a single environment variable. Get started by reading the guides for tracing with [LangChain](/langsmith/trace-with-langchain) or tracing with [LangGraph](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph).
</Tip>

## 1. Create a directory and install dependencies

In your terminal, create a directory for your project and install the dependencies in your environment:

## 2. Set up environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

* `LANGSMITH_TRACING`
* `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
* `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or your LLM provider's API key)
* (optional) `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID`: If your LangSmith API is linked to multiple workspaces, set this variable to specify which workspace to use.

If you're using Anthropic, use the [Anthropic wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#wrap-the-anthropic-client-python-only) to trace your calls. For other providers, use [the traceable wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#use-%40traceable-%2F-traceable).

## 3. Define your application

You can use the example app code outlined in this step to instrument a RAG application. Or, you can use your own application code that includes an LLM call.

This is a minimal RAG app that uses the OpenAI SDK directly without any LangSmith tracing added yet. It has three main parts:

* **Retriever function**: Simulates document retrieval that always returns the same string.
* **OpenAI client**: Instantiates a plain OpenAI client to send a chat completion request.
* **RAG function**: Combines the retrieved documents with the user’s question to form a system prompt, calls the `chat.completions.create()` endpoint with `gpt-4o-mini`, and returns the assistant’s response.

Add the following code into your app file (e.g., `app.py` or `app.ts`):

## 4. Trace LLM calls

To start, you’ll trace all your OpenAI calls. LangSmith provides wrappers:

* Python: [`wrap_openai`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/wrappers/langsmith.wrappers._openai.wrap_openai)
* TypeScript: [`wrapOpenAI`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/js/functions/wrappers_openai.wrapOpenAI)

This snippet wraps the OpenAI client so that every subsequent model call is logged automatically as a traced child run in LangSmith.

1. Include the highlighted lines in your app file:

2. Call your application:

You'll receive the following output:

3. In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), navigate to the **default** Tracing Project for your workspace (or the workspace you specified in [Step 2](#2-set-up-environment-variables)). You'll see the OpenAI call you just instrumented.

## 5. Trace an entire application

You can also use the `traceable` decorator for [Python](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/run_helpers/langsmith.run_helpers.traceable) or [TypeScript](https://langsmith-docs-bdk0fivr6-langchain.vercel.app/reference/js/functions/traceable.traceable) to trace your entire application instead of just the LLM calls.

1. Include the highlighted code in your app file:

2. Call the application again to create a run:

3. Return to the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), navigate to the **default** Tracing Project for your workspace (or the workspace you specified in [Step 2](#2-set-up-environment-variables)). You'll find a trace of the entire app pipeline with the **rag** step and the **ChatOpenAI** LLM call.

[`deepagents`](https://pypi.org/project/deepagents/) is a standalone library for building agents that can tackle complex, multi-step tasks. Built on LangGraph and inspired by applications like Claude Code, Deep Research, and Manus, deep agents come with planning capabilities, file systems for context management, and the ability to spawn subagents.

## When to use deep agents

Use deep agents when you need agents that can:

* **Handle complex, multi-step tasks** that require planning and decomposition
* **Manage large amounts of context** through file system tools
* **Delegate work** to specialized subagents for context isolation
* **Persist memory** across conversations and threads

For simpler use cases, consider using LangChain's [`create_agent`](/oss/python/langchain/agents) or building a custom [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) workflow.

<Card title="Planning and task decomposition" icon="timeline">
  Deep agents include a built-in `write_todos` tool that enables agents to break down complex tasks into discrete steps, track progress, and adapt plans as new information emerges.
</Card>

<Card title="Context management" icon="scissors">
  File system tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`) allow agents to offload large context to memory, preventing context window overflow and enabling work with variable-length tool results.

## Relationship to the LangChain ecosystem

Deep agents is built on top of:

* **LangGraph** - Provides the underlying graph execution and state management
* **LangChain** - Tools and model integrations work seamlessly with deep agents
* **LangSmith** - Observability and deployment through LangGraph Platform

Deep agents applications can be deployed via [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments) and monitored with [LangSmith Observability](/langsmith/observability).

## Use an existing secret for your installation (Kubernetes)

**URL:** llms-txt#use-an-existing-secret-for-your-installation-(kubernetes)

**Contents:**
- Requirements
- Parameters
- Configuration

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/self-host-using-an-existing-secret

By default, LangSmith will provision several Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive information such as license keys, salts, and other configuration parameters. However, you may want to use an existing secret that you have already created in your Kubernetes cluster (or provisioned via some sort of secrets operator). This can be useful if you want to manage sensitive information in a centralized way or if you have specific security requirements.

By default we will provision the following secrets corresponding to different components of LangSmith:

* `langsmith-secrets`: This secret contains the license key and some other basic configuration parameters. You can see the template for this secret [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/templates/secrets.yaml)
* `langsmith-redis`: This secret contains the Redis connection string and password. You can see the template for this secret [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/templates/redis/secrets.yaml)
* `langsmith-postgres`: This secret contains the Postgres connection string and password. You can see the template for this secret [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/templates/postgres/secrets.yaml)
* `langsmith-clickhouse`: This secret contains the ClickHouse connection string and password. You can see the template for this secret [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/templates/clickhouse/secrets.yaml)

* An existing Kubernetes cluster
* A way to create Kubernetes secrets in your cluster. This can be done using `kubectl`, a Helm chart, or a secrets operator like [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)

You will need to create your own Kubernetes secrets that adhere to the structure of the secrets provisioned by the LangSmith Helm Chart.

<Warning>
  The secrets must have the same structure as the ones provisioned by the LangSmith Helm Chart (refer to the links above to see the specific secrets). If you miss any of the required keys, your LangSmith instance may not work correctly.
</Warning>

An example secret may look like this:

With these secrets provisioned, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use the secrets directly to avoid passing in secret values through plaintext. You can do this by modifying the `langsmith_config.yaml` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation.

Once configured, you will need to update your LangSmith installation. You can follow our upgrade guide [here](/langsmith/self-host-upgrades). If everything is configured correctly, your LangSmith instance should now be accessible via the Ingress. You can run the following to check that your secrets are being used correctly:

You should see something like this in the output:

This is the comprehensive setup and management guide for deploying applications to LangSmith Cloud.

<Callout icon="zap" color="#4F46E5" iconType="regular">
  **Looking for a quick setup?** Try the [quickstart guide](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart) first.
</Callout>

Before setting up, review the [Cloud overview page](/langsmith/cloud) to understand the Cloud hosting model.

1. LangSmith applications are deployed from GitHub repositories. Configure and upload a LangSmith application to a GitHub repository in order to deploy it to LangSmith.
2. [Verify that the LangGraph API runs locally](/langsmith/local-server). If the API does not run successfully (i.e. `langgraph dev`), deploying to LangSmith will fail as well.

## Create New Deployment

Starting from the <a href="https://smith.langchain.com/" target="_blank">LangSmith UI</a>:

1. In the left-hand navigation panel, select **Deployments**, which contains a list of existing deployments.
2. In the top-right corner, select **+ New Deployment** to create a new deployment.
3. In the `Create New Deployment` panel, fill out the required fields.
4. `Deployment details`
5. Select `Import from GitHub` and follow the GitHub OAuth workflow to install and authorize LangChain's `hosted-langserve` GitHub app to access the selected repositories. After installation is complete, return to the `Create New Deployment` panel and select the GitHub repository to deploy from the dropdown menu. **Note**: The GitHub user installing LangChain's `hosted-langserve` GitHub app must be an [owner](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners) of the organization or account.
6. Specify a name for the deployment.
7. Specify the desired `Git Branch`. A deployment is linked to a branch. When a new revision is created, code for the linked branch will be deployed. The branch can be updated later in the [Deployment Settings](#deployment-settings).
8. Specify the full path to the [LangGraph API config file](/langsmith/cli#configuration-file) including the file name. For example, if the file `langgraph.json` is in the root of the repository, simply specify `langgraph.json`.
9. Check/uncheck checkbox to `Automatically update deployment on push to branch`. If checked, the deployment will automatically be updated when changes are pushed to the specified `Git Branch`. This setting can be enabled/disabled later in the [Deployment Settings](#deployment-settings).
10. Select the desired `Deployment Type`.
11. `Development` deployments are meant for non-production use cases and are provisioned with minimal resources.
12. `Production` deployments can serve up to 500 requests/second and are provisioned with highly available storage with automatic backups.
13. Determine if the deployment should be `Shareable through Studio`.
14. If unchecked, the deployment will only be accessible with a valid LangSmith API key for the workspace.
15. If checked, the deployment will be accessible through Studio to any LangSmith user. A direct URL to Studio for the deployment will be provided to share with other LangSmith users.
16. Specify `Environment Variables` and secrets. See the [Environment Variables reference](/langsmith/env-var) to configure additional variables for the deployment.
17. Sensitive values such as API keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) should be specified as secrets.
18. Additional non-secret environment variables can be specified as well.
19. A new LangSmith `Tracing Project` is automatically created with the same name as the deployment.
20. In the top-right corner, select `Submit`. After a few seconds, the `Deployment` view appears and the new deployment will be queued for provisioning.

## Create New Revision

When [creating a new deployment](#create-new-deployment), a new revision is created by default. Subsequent revisions can be created to deploy new code changes.

Starting from the <a href="https://smith.langchain.com/" target="_blank">LangSmith UI</a>...

1. In the left-hand navigation panel, select **Deployments**, which contains a list of existing deployments.
2. Select an existing deployment to create a new revision for.
3. In the `Deployment` view, in the top-right corner, select `+ New Revision`.
4. In the `New Revision` modal, fill out the required fields.
5. Specify the full path to the [LangGraph API config file](/langsmith/cli#configuration-file) including the file name. For example, if the file `langgraph.json` is in the root of the repository, simply specify `langgraph.json`.
6. Determine if the deployment should be `Shareable through Studio`.
7. If unchecked, the deployment will only be accessible with a valid LangSmith API key for the workspace.
8. If checked, the deployment will be accessible through Studio to any LangSmith user. A direct URL to Studio for the deployment will be provided to share with other LangSmith users.
9. Specify `Environment Variables` and secrets. Existing secrets and environment variables are prepopulated. See the [Environment Variables reference](/langsmith/env-var) to configure additional variables for the revision.
10. Add new secrets or environment variables.
11. Remove existing secrets or environment variables.
12. Update the value of existing secrets or environment variables.
13. Select `Submit`. After a few seconds, the `New Revision` modal will close and the new revision will be queued for deployment.

## View Build and Server Logs

Build and server logs are available for each revision.

Starting from the **Deployments** view:

1. Select the desired revision from the `Revisions` table. A panel slides open from the right-hand side and the `Build` tab is selected by default, which displays build logs for the revision.
2. In the panel, select the `Server` tab to view server logs for the revision. Server logs are only available after a revision has been deployed.
3. Within the `Server` tab, adjust the date/time range picker as needed. By default, the date/time range picker is set to the `Last 7 days`.

## View Deployment Metrics

Starting from the <a href="https://smith.langchain.com/" target="_blank">LangSmith UI</a>...

1. In the left-hand navigation panel, select **Deployments**, which contains a list of existing deployments.
2. Select an existing deployment to monitor.
3. Select the `Monitoring` tab to view the deployment metrics. See a list of [all available metrics](/langsmith/control-plane#monitoring).
4. Within the `Monitoring` tab, use the date/time range picker as needed. By default, the date/time range picker is set to the `Last 15 minutes`.

## Interrupt Revision

Interrupting a revision will stop deployment of the revision.

<Warning>
  **Undefined Behavior**
  Interrupted revisions have undefined behavior. This is only useful if you need to deploy a new revision and you already have a revision "stuck" in progress. In the future, this feature may be removed.
</Warning>

Starting from the **Deployments** view:

1. Select the menu icon (three dots) on the right-hand side of the row for the desired revision from the `Revisions` table.
2. Select `Interrupt` from the menu.
3. A modal will appear. Review the confirmation message. Select `Interrupt revision`.

Starting from the <a href="https://smith.langchain.com/" target="_blank">LangSmith UI</a>...

1. In the left-hand navigation panel, select **Deployments**, which contains a list of existing deployments.
2. Select the menu icon (three dots) on the right-hand side of the row for the desired deployment and select `Delete`.
3. A `Confirmation` modal will appear. Select `Delete`.

## Deployment Settings

Starting from the **Deployments** view:

1. In the top-right corner, select the gear icon (`Deployment Settings`).
2. Update the `Git Branch` to the desired branch.
3. Check/uncheck checkbox to `Automatically update deployment on push to branch`.
4. Branch creation/deletion and tag creation/deletion events will not trigger an update. Only pushes to an existing branch will trigger an update.
5. Pushes in quick succession to a branch will queue subsequent updates. Once a build completes, the most recent commit will begin building and the other queued builds will be skipped.

## Add or Remove GitHub Repositories

After installing and authorizing LangChain's `hosted-langserve` GitHub app, repository access for the app can be modified to add new repositories or remove existing repositories. If a new repository is created, it may need to be added explicitly.

1. From the GitHub profile, navigate to `Settings` > `Applications` > `hosted-langserve` > click `Configure`.
2. Under `Repository access`, select `All repositories` or `Only select repositories`. If `Only select repositories` is selected, new repositories must be explicitly added.
3. Click `Save`.
4. When creating a new deployment, the list of GitHub repositories in the dropdown menu will be updated to reflect the repository access changes.

## Allowlisting IP Addresses

All traffic from LangSmith deployments created after January 6th 2025 will come through a NAT gateway.
This NAT gateway will have several static ip addresses depending on the region you are deploying in. Refer to the table below for the list of IP addresses to allowlist:

| US             | EU             |

Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents-- including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more-- LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent **orchestration**. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with [models](/oss/python/langchain/models) and [tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools).

We will commonly use [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don't need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain's [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents) that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.

LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.

## <Icon icon="download" size={20} /> Install

Then, create a simple hello world example:

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

* [Durable execution](/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.
* [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts): Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.
* [Comprehensive memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory): Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.
* [Debugging with LangSmith](/langsmith/home): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
* [Production-ready deployment](/langsmith/deployments): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

* [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
* [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [Studio](/langsmith/studio).
* [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) - Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development. Contains agent abstractions built on top of LangGraph.

LangGraph is inspired by [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pub37252/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/). The public interface draws inspiration from [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/). LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.

## Graph API overview

**URL:** llms-txt#graph-api-overview

**Contents:**
- Graphs
  - StateGraph
  - Compiling your graph
- State
  - Schema

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api

At its core, LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs. You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:

1. [`State`](#state): A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any data type, but is typically defined using a shared state schema.

2. [`Nodes`](#nodes): Functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current state as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated state.

3. [`Edges`](#edges): Functions that determine which `Node` to execute next based on the current state. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.

By composing `Nodes` and `Edges`, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the state over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that state. To emphasize: `Nodes` and `Edges` are nothing more than functions - they can contain an LLM or just good ol' code.

In short: *nodes do the work, edges tell what to do next*.

LangGraph's underlying graph algorithm uses [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) to define a general program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. Inspired by Google's [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pregel-a-system-for-large-scale-graph-processing/) system, the program proceeds in discrete "super-steps."

A super-step can be considered a single iteration over the graph nodes. Nodes that run in parallel are part of the same super-step, while nodes that run sequentially belong to separate super-steps. At the start of graph execution, all nodes begin in an `inactive` state. A node becomes `active` when it receives a new message (state) on any of its incoming edges (or "channels"). The active node then runs its function and responds with updates. At the end of each super-step, nodes with no incoming messages vote to `halt` by marking themselves as `inactive`. The graph execution terminates when all nodes are `inactive` and no messages are in transit.

The [`StateGraph`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph) class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by a user defined `State` object.

### Compiling your graph

To build your graph, you first define the [state](#state), you then add [nodes](#nodes) and [edges](#edges), and then you compile it. What exactly is compiling your graph and why is it needed?

Compiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where you can specify runtime args like [checkpointers](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) and breakpoints. You compile your graph by just calling the `.compile` method:

You **MUST** compile your graph before you can use it.

The first thing you do when you define a graph is define the `State` of the graph. The `State` consists of the [schema of the graph](#schema) as well as [`reducer` functions](#reducers) which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the `State` will be the input schema to all `Nodes` and `Edges` in the graph, and can be either a `TypedDict` or a `Pydantic` model. All `Nodes` will emit updates to the `State` which are then applied using the specified `reducer` function.

The main documented way to specify the schema of a graph is by using a [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict). If you want to provide default values in your state, use a [`dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). We also support using a Pydantic [BaseModel](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api.md#use-pydantic-models-for-graph-state) as your graph state if you want recursive data validation (though note that pydantic is less performant than a `TypedDict` or `dataclass`).

By default, the graph will have the same input and output schemas. If you want to change this, you can also specify explicit input and output schemas directly. This is useful when you have a lot of keys, and some are explicitly for input and others for output. See the [guide here](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api.md#define-input-and-output-schemas) for how to use.

#### Multiple schemas

Typically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want more control over this:

* Internal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph's input / output.
* We may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key.

It is possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal node communication. We can simply define a private schema, `PrivateState`.

It is also possible to define explicit input and output schemas for a graph. In these cases, we define an "internal" schema that contains *all* keys relevant to graph operations. But, we also define `input` and `output` schemas that are sub-sets of the "internal" schema to constrain the input and output of the graph. See [this guide](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#define-input-and-output-schemas) for more detail.

Let's look at an example:

```python  theme={null}
class InputState(TypedDict):
    user_input: str

class OutputState(TypedDict):
    graph_output: str

class OverallState(TypedDict):
    foo: str
    user_input: str
    graph_output: str

class PrivateState(TypedDict):
    bar: str

def node_1(state: InputState) -> OverallState:
    # Write to OverallState
    return {"foo": state["user_input"] + " name"}

def node_2(state: OverallState) -> PrivateState:
    # Read from OverallState, write to PrivateState
    return {"bar": state["foo"] + " is"}

def node_3(state: PrivateState) -> OutputState:
    # Read from PrivateState, write to OutputState
    return {"graph_output": state["bar"] + " Lance"}

builder = StateGraph(OverallState,input_schema=InputState,output_schema=OutputState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
builder.add_node("node_2", node_2)
builder.add_node("node_3", node_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
builder.add_edge("node_2", "node_3")
builder.add_edge("node_3", END)

graph = builder.compile()
graph.invoke({"user_input":"My"})

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
You **MUST** compile your graph before you can use it.

## State

The first thing you do when you define a graph is define the `State` of the graph. The `State` consists of the [schema of the graph](#schema) as well as [`reducer` functions](#reducers) which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the `State` will be the input schema to all `Nodes` and `Edges` in the graph, and can be either a `TypedDict` or a `Pydantic` model. All `Nodes` will emit updates to the `State` which are then applied using the specified `reducer` function.

### Schema

The main documented way to specify the schema of a graph is by using a [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict). If you want to provide default values in your state, use a [`dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). We also support using a Pydantic [BaseModel](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api.md#use-pydantic-models-for-graph-state) as your graph state if you want recursive data validation (though note that pydantic is less performant than a `TypedDict` or `dataclass`).

By default, the graph will have the same input and output schemas. If you want to change this, you can also specify explicit input and output schemas directly. This is useful when you have a lot of keys, and some are explicitly for input and others for output. See the [guide here](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api.md#define-input-and-output-schemas) for how to use.

#### Multiple schemas

Typically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want more control over this:

* Internal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph's input / output.
* We may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key.

It is possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal node communication. We can simply define a private schema, `PrivateState`.

It is also possible to define explicit input and output schemas for a graph. In these cases, we define an "internal" schema that contains *all* keys relevant to graph operations. But, we also define `input` and `output` schemas that are sub-sets of the "internal" schema to constrain the input and output of the graph. See [this guide](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#define-input-and-output-schemas) for more detail.

Let's look at an example:

## Evaluation quickstart

**URL:** llms-txt#evaluation-quickstart

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Video guide

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/evaluation-quickstart

[*Evaluations*](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts) are a quantitative way to measure the performance of LLM applications. LLMs can behave unpredictably, even small changes to prompts, models, or inputs can significantly affect results. Evaluations provide a structured way to identify failures, compare versions, and build more reliable AI applications.

Running an evaluation in LangSmith requires three key components:

* [*Dataset*](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#datasets): A set of test inputs (and optionally, expected outputs).
* [*Target function*](/langsmith/define-target-function): The part of your application you want to test—this might be a single LLM call with a new prompt, one module, or your entire workflow.
* [*Evaluators*](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#evaluators): Functions that score your target function’s outputs.

This quickstart guides you through running a starter evaluation that checks the correctness of LLM responses, using either the LangSmith SDK or UI.

<Tip>
  If you prefer to watch a video on getting started with tracing, refer to the datasets and evaluations [Video guide](#video-guide).
</Tip>

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **A LangSmith account**: Sign up or log in at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com).
* **A LangSmith API key**: Follow the [Create an API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key#create-an-api-key) guide.
* **An OpenAI API key**: Generate this from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

**Select the UI or SDK filter for instructions:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UI" icon="window">
    ## 1. Set workspace secrets

In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), ensure that your OpenAI API key is set as a [workspace secret](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspace-secrets).

1. Navigate to <Icon icon="gear" /> **Settings** and then move to the **Secrets** tab.
    2. Select **Add secret** and enter the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and your API key as the **Value**.
    3. Select **Save secret**.

<Note> When adding workspace secrets in the LangSmith UI, make sure the secret keys match the environment variable names expected by your model provider.</Note>

## 2. Create a prompt

LangSmith's [Prompt Playground](/langsmith/observability-concepts#prompt-playground) makes it possible to run evaluations over different prompts, new models, or test different model configurations.

1. In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), navigate to the **Playground** under **Prompt Engineering**.
    2. Under the **Prompts** panel, modify the **system** prompt to:

Leave the **Human** message as is: `{question}`.

## 3. Create a dataset

1. Click **Set up Evaluation**, which will open a **New Experiment** table at the bottom of the page.

2. In the **Select or create a new dataset** dropdown, click the **+ New** button to create a new dataset.

    <Tip>
      This guide uses prebuilt LLM-as-judge evaluators from the open-source [`openevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) package. OpenEvals includes a set of commonly used evaluators and is a great starting point if you're new to evaluations. If you want greater flexibility in how you evaluate your apps, you can also [define completely custom evaluators](/langsmith/code-evaluator).
    </Tip>

## 1. Install dependencies

In your terminal, create a directory for your project and install the dependencies in your environment:

<Info>
      If you are using `yarn` as your package manager, you will also need to manually install `@langchain/core` as a peer dependency of `openevals`. This is not required for LangSmith evals in general, you may define evaluators [using arbitrary custom code](/langsmith/code-evaluator).
    </Info>

## 2. Set up environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

* `LANGSMITH_TRACING`
    * `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
    * `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or your LLM provider's API key)
    * (optional) `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID`: If your LangSmith API is linked to multiple [workspaces](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces), set this variable to specify which workspace to use.

<Note>
      If you're using Anthropic, use the [Anthropic wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#wrap-the-anthropic-client-python-only) to trace your calls. For other providers, use [the traceable wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#use-%40traceable-%2F-traceable).
    </Note>

## 3. Create a dataset

1. Create a file and add the following code, which will:

* Import the `Client` to connect to LangSmith.
       * Create a dataset.
       * Define example [*inputs* and *outputs*](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#examples).
       * Associate the input and output pairs with that dataset in LangSmith so they can be used in evaluations.

2. In your terminal, run the `dataset` file to create the datasets you'll use to evaluate your app:

You'll see the following output:

## 4. Create your target function

Define a [target function](/langsmith/define-target-function) that contains what you're evaluating. In this guide, you'll define a target function that contains a single LLM call to answer a question.

Add the following to an `eval` file:

## 5. Define an evaluator

In this step, you’re telling LangSmith how to grade the answers your app produces.

Import a prebuilt evaluation prompt (`CORRECTNESS_PROMPT`) from [`openevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) and a helper that wraps it into an [*LLM-as-judge evaluator*](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts#llm-as-judge), which will score the application's output.

<Info>
      `CORRECTNESS_PROMPT` is just an f-string with variables for `"inputs"`, `"outputs"`, and `"reference_outputs"`. See [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals#customizing-prompts) for more information on customizing OpenEvals prompts.
    </Info>

The evaluator compares:

* `inputs`: what was passed into your target function (e.g., the question text).
    * `outputs`: what your target function returned (e.g., the model’s answer).
    * `reference_outputs`: the ground truth answers you attached to each dataset example in [Step 3](#3-create-a-dataset).

Add the following highlighted code to your `eval` file:

## 6. Run and view results

To run the evaluation experiment, you'll call `evaluate(...)`, which:

* Pulls example from the dataset you created in [Step 3](#3-create-a-dataset).
    * Sends each example's inputs to your target function from [Step 4](#4-add-an-evaluator).
    * Collects the outputs (the model's answers).
    * Passes the outputs along with the `reference_outputs` to your evaluator from [Step 5](#5-define-an-evaluator).
    * Records all results in LangSmith as an experiment, so you can view them in the UI.

1. Add the highlighted code to your `eval` file:

2. Run your evaluator:

3. You'll receive a link to view the evaluation results and metadata for the experiment results:

4. Follow the link in the output of your evaluation run to access the **Datasets & Experiments** page in the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), and explore the results of the experiment. This will direct you to the created experiment with a table showing the **Inputs**, **Reference Output**, and **Outputs**. You can select a dataset to open an expanded view of the results.

```unknown
</CodeGroup>

    <Info>
      If you are using `yarn` as your package manager, you will also need to manually install `@langchain/core` as a peer dependency of `openevals`. This is not required for LangSmith evals in general, you may define evaluators [using arbitrary custom code](/langsmith/code-evaluator).
    </Info>

    ## 2. Set up environment variables

    Set the following environment variables:

    * `LANGSMITH_TRACING`
    * `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
    * `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or your LLM provider's API key)
    * (optional) `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID`: If your LangSmith API is linked to multiple [workspaces](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces), set this variable to specify which workspace to use.
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
<Note>
      If you're using Anthropic, use the [Anthropic wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#wrap-the-anthropic-client-python-only) to trace your calls. For other providers, use [the traceable wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#use-%40traceable-%2F-traceable).

## Context overview

**URL:** llms-txt#context-overview

**Contents:**
- Static runtime context
- Dynamic runtime context
- Dynamic cross-conversation context
- See also

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/concepts/context

**Context engineering** is the practice of building dynamic systems that provide the right information and tools, in the right format, so that an AI application can accomplish a task. Context can be characterized along two key dimensions:

1. By **mutability**:

* **Static context**: Immutable data that doesn't change during execution (e.g., user metadata, database connections, tools)
* **Dynamic context**: Mutable data that evolves as the application runs (e.g., conversation history, intermediate results, tool call observations)

* **Runtime context**: Data scoped to a single run or invocation
* **Cross-conversation context**: Data that persists across multiple conversations or sessions

<Tip>
  Runtime context refers to local context: data and dependencies your code needs to run. It does **not** refer to:

* The LLM context, which is the data passed into the LLM's prompt.
  * The "context window", which is the maximum number of tokens that can be passed to the LLM.

Runtime context can be used to optimize the LLM context. For example, you can use user metadata
  in the runtime context to fetch user preferences and feed them into the context window.
</Tip>

LangGraph provides three ways to manage context, which combines the mutability and lifetime dimensions:

| Context type                                                                                | Description                                            | Mutability | Lifetime           | Access method                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| [**Static runtime context**](#static-runtime-context)                                       | User metadata, tools, db connections passed at startup | Static     | Single run         | `context` argument to `invoke`/`stream` |
| [**Dynamic runtime context (state)**](#dynamic-runtime-context-state)                       | Mutable data that evolves during a single run          | Dynamic    | Single run         | LangGraph state object                  |
| [**Dynamic cross-conversation context (store)**](#dynamic-cross-conversation-context-store) | Persistent data shared across conversations            | Dynamic    | Cross-conversation | LangGraph store                         |

## Static runtime context

**Static runtime context** represents immutable data like user metadata, tools, and database connections that are passed to an application at the start of a run via the `context` argument to `invoke`/`stream`. This data does not change during execution.

<Tip>
  The `Runtime` object can be used to access static context and other utilities like the active store and stream writer.
  See the @\[`Runtime`]\[langgraph.runtime.Runtime] documentation for details.
</Tip>

## Dynamic runtime context

**Dynamic runtime context** represents mutable data that can evolve during a single run and is managed through the LangGraph state object. This includes conversation history, intermediate results, and values derived from tools or LLM outputs. In LangGraph, the state object acts as [short-term memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory) during a run.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="In an agent">
    Example shows how to incorporate state into an agent **prompt**.

State can also be accessed by the agent's **tools**, which can read or update the state as needed. See [tool calling guide](/oss/python/langchain/tools#short-term-memory) for details.

<Tip>
  **Turning on memory**
  Please see the [memory guide](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory) for more details on how to enable memory. This is a powerful feature that allows you to persist the agent's state across multiple invocations. Otherwise, the state is scoped only to a single run.
</Tip>

## Dynamic cross-conversation context

**Dynamic cross-conversation context** represents persistent, mutable data that spans across multiple conversations or sessions and is managed through the LangGraph store. This includes user profiles, preferences, and historical interactions. The LangGraph store acts as [long-term memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory#long-term-memory) across multiple runs. This can be used to read or update persistent facts (e.g., user profiles, preferences, prior interactions).

However, if you are running LangSmith in an environment that does not have internet access, or if you would like to use a private Docker registry, you can mirror the images to your own registry and then configure your LangSmith installation to use those images.

* Authenticated access to a Docker registry that your Kubernetes cluster/machine has access to.
* Docker installed on your local machine or a machine that has access to the Docker registry.
* A Kubernetes cluster or a machine where you can run LangSmith.

## Mirroring the Images

For your convenience, we have provided a script that will mirror the images for you. You can find the script in the [LangSmith Helm Chart repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/scripts/mirror_langsmith_images.sh)

To use the script, you will need to run the script with the following command specifying your registry and platform:

Where `<your-registry>` is the URL of your Docker registry (e.g. `myregistry.com`) and `<platform>` is the platform you are using (e.g. `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, etc.). If you do not specify a platform, it will default to `linux/amd64`.

For example, if your registry is `myregistry.com`, your platform is `linux/arm64`, and you want to use the latest version of the images, you would run:

Note that this script will assume that you have Docker installed and that you are authenticated to your registry. It will also push the images to the specified registry with the same repository/tag as the original images.

Alternatively, you can pull, mirror, and push the images manually. The images that you will need to mirror are found in the `values.yaml` file of the LangSmith Helm Chart. These can be found here: [LangSmith Helm Chart values.yaml](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/values.yaml#L14)

Here is an example of how to mirror the images using Docker:

```bash  theme={null}

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
Where `<your-registry>` is the URL of your Docker registry (e.g. `myregistry.com`) and `<platform>` is the platform you are using (e.g. `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, etc.). If you do not specify a platform, it will default to `linux/amd64`.

For example, if your registry is `myregistry.com`, your platform is `linux/arm64`, and you want to use the latest version of the images, you would run:

**Contents:**
- Installation
- Quick start
  - 1. Configure your environment
  - 2. Log a trace
  - 3. View your trace

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/trace-with-langchain

LangSmith integrates seamlessly with LangChain (Python and JavaScript), the popular open-source framework for building LLM applications.

Install the core library and the OpenAI integration for Python and JS (we use the OpenAI integration for the code snippets below).

For a full list of packages available, see the [LangChain docs](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview).

### 1. Configure your environment

<Info>
  If you are using LangChain.js with LangSmith and are not in a serverless environment, we also recommend setting the following explicitly to reduce latency:

`export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true`

If you are in a serverless environment, we recommend setting the reverse to allow tracing to finish before your function ends:

`export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=false`
</Info>

No extra code is needed to log a trace to LangSmith. Just run your LangChain code as you normally would.

### 3. View your trace

By default, the trace will be logged to the project with the name `default`. An example of a trace logged using the above code is made public and can be viewed [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/e6a46eb2-d785-4804-a1e3-23f167a04300/r).

The [previous section](#quick-start) showed how to trace all invocations of a LangChain runnables within your applications by setting a single environment variable. While this is a convenient way to get started, you may want to trace only specific invocations or parts of your application.

There are two ways to do this in Python: by manually passing in a `LangChainTracer` instance as a [callback](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/callbacks/), or by using the [`tracing_context` context manager](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langsmith/observability/sdk/run_helpers/#langsmith.run_helpers.tracing_context).

In JS/TS, you can pass a [`LangChainTracer`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/classes/_langchain_core.tracers_tracer_langchain.LangChainTracer.html) instance as a callback.

## Log to a specific project

As mentioned in the [tracing conceptual guide](/langsmith/observability-concepts) LangSmith uses the concept of a Project to group traces. If left unspecified, the tracer project is set to default. You can set the `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` environment variable to configure a custom project name for an entire application run. This should be done before executing your application.

<Warning>
  The `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` flag is only supported in JS SDK versions >= 0.2.16, use `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` instead if you are using an older version.
</Warning>

This largely builds off of the [previous section](#trace-selectively) and allows you to set the project name for a specific `LangChainTracer` instance or as parameters to the `tracing_context` context manager in Python.

## Add metadata and tags to traces

You can annotate your traces with arbitrary metadata and tags by providing them in the [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/?h=runnablecon#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig). This is useful for associating additional information with a trace, such as the environment in which it was executed, or the user who initiated it. For information on how to query traces and runs by metadata and tags, see [this guide](/langsmith/export-traces)

<Note>
  When you attach metadata or tags to a runnable (either through the [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) or at runtime with invocation params), they are inherited by all child runnables of that runnable.
</Note>

## Customize run name

You can customize the name of a given run when invoking or streaming your LangChain code by providing it in the [Config](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/?h=runnablecon#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig). This name is used to identify the run in LangSmith and can be used to filter and group runs. The name is also used as the title of the run in the LangSmith UI. This can be done by setting a `run_name` in the [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) object at construction or by passing a `run_name` in the invocation parameters in JS/TS.

<Note>
  The `run_name` parameter only changes the name of the runnable you invoke (e.g., a chain, function). It does not rename the nested run automatically created when you invoke an LLM object like [`ChatOpenAI`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/ChatOpenAI/) (`gpt-4o-mini`). In the example, the enclosing run will appear in LangSmith as `MyCustomChain`, while the nested LLM run still shows the model’s default name.

To give the LLM run a more meaningful name, you can either:

* Wrap the model in another runnable and assign a `run_name` to that step.
  * Use a tracing decorator or helper (e.g., `@traceable` in Python, or `traceable` from `langsmith` in JS/TS) to create a custom run around the model call.
</Note>

You can customize the ID of a given run when invoking or streaming your LangChain code by providing it in the [Config](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/?h=runnablecon#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig). This ID is used to uniquely identify the run in LangSmith and can be used to query specific runs. The ID can be useful for linking runs across different systems or for implementing custom tracking logic. This can be done by setting a `run_id` in the [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) object at construction or by passing a `run_id` in the invocation parameters.

<Note>
  This feature is not currently supported directly for LLM objects.
</Note>

Note that if you do this at the **root** of a trace (i.e., the top-level run, that run ID will be used as the `trace_id`).

## Access run (span) ID for LangChain invocations

When you invoke a LangChain object, you can manually specify the run ID of the invocation. This run ID can be used to query the run in LangSmith.

In JS/TS, you can use a `RunCollectorCallbackHandler` instance to access the run ID.

## Ensure all traces are submitted before exiting

In LangChain Python, LangSmith's tracing is done in a background thread to avoid obstructing your production application. This means that your process may end before all traces are successfully posted to LangSmith. This is especially prevalent in a serverless environment, where your VM may be terminated immediately once your chain or agent completes.

You can make callbacks synchronous by setting the `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` environment variable to `"false"`.

For both languages, LangChain exposes methods to wait for traces to be submitted before exiting your application. Below is an example:

## Trace without setting environment variables

As mentioned in other guides, the following environment variables allow you to configure tracing enabled, the api endpoint, the api key, and the tracing project:

* `LANGSMITH_TRACING`
* `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
* `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`
* `LANGSMITH_PROJECT`

However, in some environments, it is not possible to set environment variables. In these cases, you can set the tracing configuration programmatically.

This largely builds off of the [previous section](#trace-selectively).

## Distributed tracing with LangChain (Python)

LangSmith supports distributed tracing with LangChain Python. This allows you to link runs (spans) across different services and applications. The principles are similar to the [distributed tracing guide](/langsmith/distributed-tracing) for the LangSmith SDK.

LangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs. With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and [more](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview). LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.

We recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview), our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.

LangChain [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents) are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/quickstart

This quickstart demonstrates how to build a calculator agent using the LangGraph Graph API or the Functional API.

* [Use the Graph API](#use-the-graph-api) if you prefer to define your agent as a graph of nodes and edges.
* [Use the Functional API](#use-the-functional-api) if you prefer to define your agent as a single function.

<Tip>
  For conceptual information, see [Graph API overview](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api) and [Functional API overview](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api).
</Tip>

<Info>
  For this example, you will need to set up a [Claude (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/) account and get an API key. Then, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in your terminal.

  <Tab title="Use the Graph API">
    ## 1. Define tools and model

In this example, we'll use the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model and define tools for addition, multiplication, and division.

The graph's state is used to store the messages and the number of LLM calls.

<Tip>
      State in LangGraph persists throughout the agent's execution.

The `Annotated` type with `operator.add` ensures that new messages are appended to the existing list rather than replacing it.
    </Tip>

## 3. Define model node

The model node is used to call the LLM and decide whether to call a tool or not.

## 4. Define tool node

The tool node is used to call the tools and return the results.

## 5. Define end logic

The conditional edge function is used to route to the tool node or end based upon whether the LLM made a tool call.

## 6. Build and compile the agent

The agent is built using the [`StateGraph`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph) class and compiled using the [`compile`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph.compile) method.

Congratulations! You've built your first agent using the LangGraph Graph API.

<Tip>
      The [`@task`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.task) decorator marks a function as a task that can be executed as part of the agent. Tasks can be called synchronously or asynchronously within your entrypoint function.
    </Tip>

## 3. Define tool node

The tool node is used to call the tools and return the results.

The agent is built using the [`@entrypoint`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint) function.

<Note>
      In the Functional API, instead of defining nodes and edges explicitly, you write standard control flow logic (loops, conditionals) within a single function.
    </Note>

Congratulations! You've built your first agent using the LangGraph Functional API.

The **Functional API** allows you to add LangGraph's key features — [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory), [human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts), and [streaming](/oss/python/langgraph/streaming) — to your applications with minimal changes to your existing code.

It is designed to integrate these features into existing code that may use standard language primitives for branching and control flow, such as `if` statements, `for` loops, and function calls. Unlike many data orchestration frameworks that require restructuring code into an explicit pipeline or DAG, the Functional API allows you to incorporate these capabilities without enforcing a rigid execution model.

The Functional API uses two key building blocks:

* **`@entrypoint`** – Marks a function as the starting point of a workflow, encapsulating logic and managing execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.
* **[`@task`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.task)** – Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.

This provides a minimal abstraction for building workflows with state management and streaming.

<Tip>
  For information on how to use the functional API, see [Use Functional API](/oss/python/langgraph/use-functional-api).

## Functional API vs. Graph API

For users who prefer a more declarative approach, LangGraph's [Graph API](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api) allows you to define workflows using a Graph paradigm. Both APIs share the same underlying runtime, so you can use them together in the same application.

Here are some key differences:

* **Control flow**: The Functional API does not require thinking about graph structure. You can use standard Python constructs to define workflows. This will usually trim the amount of code you need to write.
* **Short-term memory**: The **GraphAPI** requires declaring a [**State**](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state) and may require defining [**reducers**](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#reducers) to manage updates to the graph state. `@entrypoint` and `@tasks` do not require explicit state management as their state is scoped to the function and is not shared across functions.
* **Checkpointing**: Both APIs generate and use checkpoints. In the **Graph API** a new checkpoint is generated after every [superstep](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api). In the **Functional API**, when tasks are executed, their results are saved to an existing checkpoint associated with the given entrypoint instead of creating a new checkpoint.
* **Visualization**: The Graph API makes it easy to visualize the workflow as a graph which can be useful for debugging, understanding the workflow, and sharing with others. The Functional API does not support visualization as the graph is dynamically generated during runtime.

Below we demonstrate a simple application that writes an essay and [interrupts](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts) to request human review.

<Accordion title="Detailed Explanation">
  This workflow will write an essay about the topic "cat" and then pause to get a review from a human. The workflow can be interrupted for an indefinite amount of time until a review is provided.

When the workflow is resumed, it executes from the very start, but because the result of the `writeEssay` task was already saved, the task result will be loaded from the checkpoint instead of being recomputed.

An essay has been written and is ready for review. Once the review is provided, we can resume the workflow:

The workflow has been completed and the review has been added to the essay.
</Accordion>

The [`@entrypoint`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint) decorator can be used to create a workflow from a function. It encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling *long-running tasks* and [interrupts](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts).

An **entrypoint** is defined by decorating a function with the `@entrypoint` decorator.

The function **must accept a single positional argument**, which serves as the workflow input. If you need to pass multiple pieces of data, use a dictionary as the input type for the first argument.

Decorating a function with an `entrypoint` produces a [`Pregel`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/pregel/#langgraph.pregel.Pregel.stream) instance which helps to manage the execution of the workflow (e.g., handles streaming, resumption, and checkpointing).

You will usually want to pass a **checkpointer** to the `@entrypoint` decorator to enable persistence and use features like **human-in-the-loop**.

<Warning>
  **Serialization**
  The **inputs** and **outputs** of entrypoints must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing. Please see the [serialization](#serialization) section for more details.
</Warning>

### Injectable parameters

When declaring an `entrypoint`, you can request access to additional parameters that will be injected automatically at run time. These parameters include:

| Parameter    | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **previous** | Access the state associated with the previous `checkpoint` for the given thread. See [short-term-memory](#short-term-memory).                                               |
| **store**    | An instance of \[BaseStore]\[langgraph.store.base.BaseStore]. Useful for [long-term memory](/oss/python/langgraph/use-functional-api#long-term-memory).                     |
| **writer**   | Use to access the StreamWriter when working with Async Python \< 3.11. See [streaming with functional API for details](/oss/python/langgraph/use-functional-api#streaming). |
| **config**   | For accessing run time configuration. See [RunnableConfig](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/runnables/#runnableconfig) for information.                           |

<Warning>
  Declare the parameters with the appropriate name and type annotation.

Using the [`@entrypoint`](#entrypoint) yields a [`Pregel`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/pregel/#langgraph.pregel.Pregel.stream) object that can be executed using the `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, and `astream` methods.

Resuming an execution after an [interrupt](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) can be done by passing a **resume** value to the [`Command`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.Command) primitive.

<Tab title="Async Stream">
    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Resuming after an error**

To resume after an error, run the `entrypoint` with a `None` and the same **thread id** (config).

This assumes that the underlying **error** has been resolved and execution can proceed successfully.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Short-term memory

When an `entrypoint` is defined with a `checkpointer`, it stores information between successive invocations on the same **thread id** in [checkpoints](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpoints).

This allows accessing the state from the previous invocation using the `previous` parameter.

By default, the `previous` parameter is the return value of the previous invocation.

#### `entrypoint.final`

[`entrypoint.final`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint.final) is a special primitive that can be returned from an entrypoint and allows **decoupling** the value that is **saved in the checkpoint** from the **return value of the entrypoint**.

The first value is the return value of the entrypoint, and the second value is the value that will be saved in the checkpoint. The type annotation is `entrypoint.final[return_type, save_type]`.

A **task** represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step. It has two key characteristics:

* **Asynchronous Execution**: Tasks are designed to be executed asynchronously, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking.
* **Checkpointing**: Task results are saved to a checkpoint, enabling resumption of the workflow from the last saved state. (See [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) for more details).

Tasks are defined using the `@task` decorator, which wraps a regular Python function.

<Warning>
  **Serialization**
  The **outputs** of tasks must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.
</Warning>

**Tasks** can only be called from within an **entrypoint**, another **task**, or a [state graph node](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#nodes).

Tasks *cannot* be called directly from the main application code.

When you call a **task**, it returns *immediately* with a future object. A future is a placeholder for a result that will be available later.

To obtain the result of a **task**, you can either wait for it synchronously (using `result()`) or await it asynchronously (using `await`).

  </Tab>

<Tab title="Asynchronous Invocation">
    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## When to use a task

**Tasks** are useful in the following scenarios:

* **Checkpointing**: When you need to save the result of a long-running operation to a checkpoint, so you don't need to recompute it when resuming the workflow.
* **Human-in-the-loop**: If you're building a workflow that requires human intervention, you MUST use **tasks** to encapsulate any randomness (e.g., API calls) to ensure that the workflow can be resumed correctly. See the [determinism](#determinism) section for more details.
* **Parallel Execution**: For I/O-bound tasks, **tasks** enable parallel execution, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking (e.g., calling multiple APIs).
* **Observability**: Wrapping operations in **tasks** provides a way to track the progress of the workflow and monitor the execution of individual operations using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).
* **Retryable Work**: When work needs to be retried to handle failures or inconsistencies, **tasks** provide a way to encapsulate and manage the retry logic.

There are two key aspects to serialization in LangGraph:

1. `entrypoint` inputs and outputs must be JSON-serializable.
2. `task` outputs must be JSON-serializable.

These requirements are necessary for enabling checkpointing and workflow resumption. Use python primitives like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, and booleans to ensure that your inputs and outputs are serializable.

Serialization ensures that workflow state, such as task results and intermediate values, can be reliably saved and restored. This is critical for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.

Providing non-serializable inputs or outputs will result in a runtime error when a workflow is configured with a checkpointer.

To utilize features like **human-in-the-loop**, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of **tasks**. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same *sequence of steps*, even if **task** results are non-deterministic.

LangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting **task** and [**subgraph**](/oss/python/langgraph/use-subgraphs) results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the *same sequence of steps*, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running **tasks** or **tasks** with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same.

While different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a **specific** run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up **task** and **subgraph** results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.

Idempotency ensures that running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. This helps prevent duplicate API calls and redundant processing if a step is rerun due to a failure. Always place API calls inside **tasks** functions for checkpointing, and design them to be idempotent in case of re-execution. Re-execution can occur if a **task** starts, but does not complete successfully. Then, if the workflow is resumed, the **task** will run again. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid duplication.

### Handling side effects

Encapsulate side effects (e.g., writing to a file, sending an email) in tasks to ensure they are not executed multiple times when resuming a workflow.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Incorrect">
    In this example, a side effect (writing to a file) is directly included in the workflow, so it will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.

<Tab title="Correct">
    In this example, the side effect is encapsulated in a task, ensuring consistent execution upon resumption.

### Non-deterministic control flow

Operations that might give different results each time (like getting current time or random numbers) should be encapsulated in tasks to ensure that on resume, the same result is returned.

* In a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → (returns 5 again) → ...
* Not in a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → get new random number (7) → ...

This is especially important when using **human-in-the-loop** workflows with multiple interrupts calls. LangGraph keeps a list of resume values for each task/entrypoint. When an interrupt is encountered, it's matched with the corresponding resume value. This matching is strictly **index-based**, so the order of the resume values should match the order of the interrupts.

If order of execution is not maintained when resuming, one [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) call may be matched with the wrong `resume` value, leading to incorrect results.

Please read the section on [determinism](#determinism) for more details.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Incorrect">
    In this example, the workflow uses the current time to determine which task to execute. This is non-deterministic because the result of the workflow depends on the time at which it is executed.

<Tab title="Correct">
    In this example, the workflow uses the input `t0` to determine which task to execute. This is deterministic because the result of the workflow depends only on the input.

## Create an Ingress for installations (Kubernetes)

**URL:** llms-txt#create-an-ingress-for-installations-(kubernetes)

**Contents:**
- Requirements
- Parameters
- Configuration
  - Option 1: Standard Ingress
  - Option 2: Gateway API
  - Option 3: Istio Gateway

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/self-host-ingress

By default, LangSmith will provision a LoadBalancer service for the `langsmith-frontend`. Depending on your cloud provider, this may result in a public IP address being assigned to the service. If you would like to use a custom domain or have more control over the routing of traffic to your LangSmith installation, you can configure an Ingress, Gateway API, or Istio Gateway.

* An existing Kubernetes cluster
* One of the following installed in your Kubernetes cluster:
  * An Ingress Controller (for standard Ingress)
  * Gateway API CRDs and a Gateway resource (for Gateway API)
  * Istio (for Istio Gateway)

You may need to provide certain parameters to your LangSmith installation to configure the Ingress. Additionally, we will want to convert the `langsmith-frontend` service to a ClusterIP service.

* *Hostname (optional)*: The hostname that you would like to use for your LangSmith installation. E.g `"langsmith.example.com"`. If you leave this empty, the ingress will serve all traffic to the LangSmith installation.

* *BasePath (optional)*: If you would like to serve LangSmith under a URL basePath, you can specify it here. For example, adding `"langsmith"` will serve the application at `"example.hostname.com/langsmith"`. This will apply to UI paths as well as API endpoints.

* *IngressClassName (optional)*: The name of the Ingress class that you would like to use. If not set, the default Ingress class will be used.

* *Annotations (optional)*: Additional annotations to add to the Ingress. Certain providers like AWS may use annotations to control things like TLS termination.

For example, you can add the following annotations using the AWS ALB Ingress Controller to attach an ACM certificate to the Ingress:

* *Labels (optional)*: Additional labels to add to the Ingress.

* *TLS (optional)*: If you would like to serve LangSmith over HTTPS, you can add TLS configuration here (many Ingress controllers may have other ways of controlling TLS so this is often not needed). This should be an array of TLS configurations. Each TLS configuration should have the following fields:

* hosts: An array of hosts that the certificate should be valid for. E.g \["langsmith.example.com"]

* secretName: The name of the Kubernetes secret that contains the certificate and private key. This secret should have the following keys:

* tls.crt: The certificate
    * tls.key: The private key

* You can read more about creating a TLS secret [here](https://kubernetes.io/do/langsmith/observability-concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls).

You can configure your LangSmith instance to use one of three routing options: standard Ingress, Gateway API, or Istio Gateway. Choose the option that best fits your infrastructure.

### Option 1: Standard Ingress

With these parameters in hand, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use an Ingress. You can do this by modifying the `config.yaml` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation.

Once configured, you will need to update your LangSmith installation. If everything is configured correctly, your LangSmith instance should now be accessible via the Ingress. You can run the following to check the status of your Ingress:

You should see something like this in the output:

<Warning>
  If you do not have automated DNS setup, you will need to add the IP address to your DNS provider manually.
</Warning>

### Option 2: Gateway API

<Note>
  Gateway API support is available as of LangSmith v0.12.0
</Note>

If your cluster uses the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/), you can configure LangSmith to provision HTTPRoute resources. This will create an HTTPRoute for LangSmith and an HTTPRoute for each [agent deployment](/langsmith/deployments).

* *name (required)*: The name of the Gateway resource to reference
* *namespace (required)*: The namespace where the Gateway resource is located
* *hostname (optional)*: The hostname that you would like to use for your LangSmith installation. E.g `"langsmith.example.com"`
* *basePath (optional)*: If you would like to serve LangSmith under a base path, you can specify it here. E.g "example.com/langsmith"
* *sectionName (optional)*: The name of a specific listener section in the Gateway to use
* *annotations (optional)*: Additional annotations to add to the HTTPRoute resources
* *labels (optional)*: Additional labels to add to the HTTPRoute resources

Once configured, you can check the status of your HTTPRoutes:

### Option 3: Istio Gateway

<Note>
  Istio Gateway support is available as of LangSmith v0.12.0
</Note>

If your cluster uses [Istio](https://istio.io/), you can configure LangSmith to provision VirtualService resources. This will create a VirtualService for LangSmith and a VirtualService for each [agent deployment](/langsmith/deployments).

* *name (optional)*: The name of the Istio Gateway resource to reference. Defaults to `"istio-gateway"`
* *namespace (optional)*: The namespace where the Istio Gateway resource is located. Defaults to `"istio-system"`
* *hostname (optional)*: The hostname that you would like to use for your LangSmith installation. E.g `"langsmith.example.com"`
* *basePath (optional)*: If you would like to serve LangSmith under a base path, you can specify it here. E.g "example.com/langsmith"
* *annotations (optional)*: Additional annotations to add to the VirtualService resources
* *labels (optional)*: Additional labels to add to the VirtualService resources

Once configured, you can check the status of your VirtualServices:

* *TLS (optional)*: If you would like to serve LangSmith over HTTPS, you can add TLS configuration here (many Ingress controllers may have other ways of controlling TLS so this is often not needed). This should be an array of TLS configurations. Each TLS configuration should have the following fields:

  * hosts: An array of hosts that the certificate should be valid for. E.g \["langsmith.example.com"]

  * secretName: The name of the Kubernetes secret that contains the certificate and private key. This secret should have the following keys:

    * tls.crt: The certificate
    * tls.key: The private key

  * You can read more about creating a TLS secret [here](https://kubernetes.io/do/langsmith/observability-concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls).

## Configuration

You can configure your LangSmith instance to use one of three routing options: standard Ingress, Gateway API, or Istio Gateway. Choose the option that best fits your infrastructure.

### Option 1: Standard Ingress

With these parameters in hand, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use an Ingress. You can do this by modifying the `config.yaml` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation.
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
Once configured, you will need to update your LangSmith installation. If everything is configured correctly, your LangSmith instance should now be accessible via the Ingress. You can run the following to check the status of your Ingress:
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
You should see something like this in the output:
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
<Warning>
  If you do not have automated DNS setup, you will need to add the IP address to your DNS provider manually.
</Warning>

### Option 2: Gateway API

<Note>
  Gateway API support is available as of LangSmith v0.12.0
</Note>

If your cluster uses the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/), you can configure LangSmith to provision HTTPRoute resources. This will create an HTTPRoute for LangSmith and an HTTPRoute for each [agent deployment](/langsmith/deployments).

#### Parameters

* *name (required)*: The name of the Gateway resource to reference
* *namespace (required)*: The namespace where the Gateway resource is located
* *hostname (optional)*: The hostname that you would like to use for your LangSmith installation. E.g `"langsmith.example.com"`
* *basePath (optional)*: If you would like to serve LangSmith under a base path, you can specify it here. E.g "example.com/langsmith"
* *sectionName (optional)*: The name of a specific listener section in the Gateway to use
* *annotations (optional)*: Additional annotations to add to the HTTPRoute resources
* *labels (optional)*: Additional labels to add to the HTTPRoute resources

#### Configuration
```
